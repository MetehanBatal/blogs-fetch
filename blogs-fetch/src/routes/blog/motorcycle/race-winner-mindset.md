# The Race Winner Mindset

<iframe title="Blog iFrame" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bHI7t-J-Dsk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

We all know that to become a race winning rider we need to combine our skills with mental and physical strength.  We often discuss what separates race winners in terms of their skill and physical abilities, but quite often the biggest differences is on their mental approach.



So, what is the race winning mindset?  How does our concious and subconcious mind affect our on track performance?



In this video we learn from race and championship winning pro-motorcycle rider, Mike Edwards that our subconcious mind has a powerful impact on our riding.  



Our subsconcious minds is constantly taking in millions of data points every lap without us even noticing.  It takes this data and stores information on things it liked or didn't like and can actually lead us to make changes to our riding without even noticing. 



Ever go through a corner and really want to attack the throttle at a certain point, but your body is just holding back and won't let you do it?  That is your subconcious mind holding you back.



So, how do we train our subconcious mind to improve?  Well, there isn't just one answer to this.  It is a combination of building consistency surrounding many different areas and we will highlight the main areas here:



### Preperation

Do you unload at the race track with lots of prep work to get your vehicle ready to race?  Does that lead you to additonal stress and pressure to hurry up and finish it to get out on the race track?



If this is you, you are immediately putting yourself in a less than ideal situation before you ever hit the race track.  Now, we know not everyone has the time to be able to do all of their prep work at home before you ever get to the track.  But, the more you can do ahead of time so that you can spend more time relaxing in a quiet spot at the track to get your mind quiet and calm the better you will do.



This point sounds so basic but do not overlook it, it is one of the most important things you can do for yourself!



### Routine

This is an area we have to be careful with.  We don't want a routine to become a ritual.  We often see athletes with a specific ritual that they absolutely have to perform to be in the right mindset.  The most famous instance of a professional athlete with a routine that he has to do is Rafeal Nadal.



Take a look at his ritual here:

Now, we all know that Rafa is a legend of the sport but he has done this **despite** his rituals, not because of them.  When we have rituals and don't have the time to do them all perfectly that sticks in the back of our mind and actually becomes a distraction.




A good routine is a much more general one.  For example making sure you have all of your stuff prepared and going through your checklist and then finding some quiet space to take a short nap.



Notice the big difference here between a supertitious ritual and a good pre-race routine.



### Goal Setting

The first step of good goal setting is making sure you set achievable goal.  If we are unrealistic with our goals then we will constantly miss them and that will hurt our confidence.


It is all about finding the fine line between too aggressive of goals or too easy of goals.  Working with a coach can really help with this!



### Strategy

Do you have a plan when you get out on track?  If not, you need to change your approach.  It doesn't matter if you are just driving at a track day or heading into the final race with a world-championship on the line, having a plan or a strategy for when you get out on track is vital.



A good plan needs to be simple and highly focused on just a few things.  We don't want to try and be working or focused on too many things at once.  



Our strategy and goals need to work together.  Once we have identified our goals we need a plan of how we are going to achieve them.  While we are on track we don't want to be focused on the goal or the result, we want to be focused on our plan that if we can achieve will mean we achieve our goal.



**To achieve our goals we must concentrate on our techniques**.



### Positive Thoughts

Wherever we can, think positive.



We want to think, I can do this, never think about what you can't do.  If you are farther back on the grid don't think, "oh no I am back on row four or five, I am screwed." rather you should be thinking, "Right, I'm back on row five, but I know I am strong on the brakes in turn 5 so I can setup overtakes there.  I know at the start a gap will open up somewhere I just need to be calm, see it early and strike decisively."



This positivity flows into our subsconcious and can give it a huge confidence boost - the importance of positive thinking can not be overstated.



### Breathing

Breathing is probably the single most impactful thing you can do as you get out on track or as you are waiting for the race starts.




Breathing has a huge impact on our heart race, our anxiety, how busy our minds are and more.  If our breathe is shallow and fast it will actually increase our heart race and anxiety, which stiffens our body which actually makes it harder for us to feel our bike or car, and it also lowers our vision.



The simple action of slowing our breathe down and ensuring we are breathing down into our abdominals and not just breathing in our chest can help us relax, calm our minds, relax our body so that we are truly in the moment.



### Focus On What You Are Out There To Do

This comes back to our plan.  We can adjust our plan depending on what our goals are.  For instance, do we want to use this practice session to improve our race starts?  Do we want to use this session to work on setup?  Or are we using this session to improve our braking technique in turn 8?




All of these require massively different plans, so we first develop that goal, then we develop the on track plan to help us achieve that goal and then we need to ensure while we are on track we use our breathe to quiet the mind and ensure we are focused on the plan we setup for ourselves.


Focuing isn't something we think about only as we get out on track.  Throughout the session we have to have the ability to check in on where our mind is and ensure it is still on the plan and that a distraction hasn't popped up and taken our mind off-track.



### Enjoy What Your Are Doing

This can be so easy to lose sight on, especially for those of us that have been competing over many, many years.



Taking a step back and just thinking about how lucky we all are to be working towards finding our vehicles limit and our limit around a race track can be instrumental on helping us loosen up.  When we no longer enjoy what we do, we have no hope on improving.  So, never lose sight of the enjoyment part of our sport!
