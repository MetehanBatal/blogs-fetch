## Barber Motorsports Park Race Track Notes

### Turn 1

A blind approach as the track drops into a dip up to the apex. Hard braking up to the tip in point then trail off the brakes towards the apex, but end your braking well before the apex; picking up the throttle as you are passing the apex.

Use all of the track out of the corner and squeeze on a short burst of acceleration, as you’re now going up a slight rise towards turn 2.

### Turn 2

A really long, looping corner that seems to go on forever.

Don’t waste any time trying to get over to the left on the approach, keep to the right. Throttle off and a light brake while you change direction, left to right, and stay over to the right. Pick up the throttle to maintain your pace and momentum around the corner, keep your line until the apex kerb, then start to develop the throttle out of the corner.

Once again use all the track out to the drift out kerb on the left, now driving hard.

### Turn 3

Basically a kink leading onto a short straight down to turn four, with both a blind apex and drift out point.

Accelerating very hard in the bottom of the dip look up to the top of the rise towards the apex, still drive hard up the rise, easing back on the throttle as you approach the crest, as the bike wants to wheelie, and rear traction is also an issue.

As you reach the crest of the rise look for the tower in the distance using this as a reference, the drift out point is to the right of this. As you pop over the rise the straight comes in to view, and the drift out kerb, use all the track out to the left, on to the short straight.

### Turn 4

On the short straight leading to turn 4 quickly bring the bike over to the right hand side of the track ready for your braking in to turn 4.

Around the 4 marker, now with the bike upright, brake hard and keep the bike over to the right. At this point the corner is still out of view. As you reach the start of the tip in kerb on the right the corner comes in to view. At the end of the kerb, still braking hard, ease the bike in towards the apex, easing back on the brakes as you close in on the first apex kerb. The apex kerb has three distinct bumps in it, using the first bump as a reference focus on the main apex, being the second bump in the kerb, picking up the throttle around this point, as from here the corner starts to open out on to another straight. At the end of the apex kerb where the third bump is, the track opens out and you’re approximately mid track at this point, also you’re going over a slight rise in the track so rear grip becomes an issue, and the straight still hasn’t come in to full view. As soon as you pop over the rise you see the straight.

### Turn 5 / chicane

Turn 5 is at the end of the straight, so make your way over to the left hand side of the track and brake somewhere between the 4 and 3 markers, ready for turn 5. This leads to a right / left / right chicane and from the first right it drops down, through the chicane until the exit right opens out on to another straight.

Most of the braking is done in a straight line with a short trail towards the apex, from the first apex as the bike comes upright, still slowing with a trail brake, you have a choice to either continue going right, to make it a chicane, or to sit the bike upright, run over the kerb to the second right, in effect making it a straight line across the kerb. As you run over the kerb release the brake and as soon as the bike lands the other side of the kerb, light squeeze of brake as you tip the bike in to the second right. Easing off the brake as you reach the storm drain on the right. From here pick up the throttle and start to develop it out of the corner looking as far round the corner as possible for a late drift out point as you go under the overhead gantry.

### Turns 8 and 9

There’s a short straight leading up to turn 8 and 9, a high speed chicane, where you enter the left faster than exiting the tighter radius right.

Making your way over to the right and roughly half way along the tip in kerb on the right start to ease the bike into the left, throttling off and a light trail of brake as you close in on the left apex, as soon as you reach the left apex, the right apex comes in to view and on a closed throttle, rapidly change direction left to right, aiming to apex the right towards the end of the kerb.

From the right apex, pick up the throttle and develop it out on to the straight looking down the track for another late drift out point.

Note: From the apex don’t look at where the bike’s going, look at where you want the bike to go.

### Turns 10 and 11

A further straight leads up to turns 10 and 11, another high speed left / right chicane, with the emphasis on the right exit. Just after the 3 marker, hard braking, keep the bike over to the right, until roughly half way along the tip in kerb on the right, still braking hard, start to ease the bike in to the left, trailing the brake off as the apex kerb comes in to view. After the left apex, only use half of the track before a rapid change of direction left to right, picking up the throttle as you close in on a late right apex. At this point in the track you’re going up a slight rise and the drift out kerb is out of view, keep accelerating and developing the throttle out of the corner, up and over the rise, using all of the track out to the left.

### Turn 12

Turn 12 is probably the most difficult corner on the circuit, starting off with an initial kink then opening out again before tightening right up at the exit; a true multi apex corner.

Cresting the rise out of turn 11 over on the left hand side of the track, throttle off and a light squeeze of brakes while still leant over to the right, start to close in on the right kerb just after the marshal’s post. As you pass the mid point of the apex kerb pick up the throttle and accelerate out in to the middle of the track until you see the pit lane entry in the distance, stay out in the track, middle to left, now lightly braking as the bike is almost at full lean at this point, trail the brake right in to the short apex kerb at the tightest point of the corner, from here pick up the throttle and a short burst of acceleration out of the corner making sure to only use half of the available track, so you can get good track position for the final corner.

### Turn 13

From the middle of the track exiting turn 12, a short burst of acceleration, bringing the bike over to the right, easing off the throttle without closing it, approximately half way along the tip in kerb on the right, ease the bike in to the final corner, progressively accelerating in towards the apex, which is towards the end of the left kerb. From here, once again look up the track for a late drift out and accelerate on to the home straight.
