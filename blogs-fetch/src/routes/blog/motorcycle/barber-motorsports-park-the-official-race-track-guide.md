## Barber Motorsports Park Official Race Track Notes

### Turn 1

Turn 1 drops steeply downhill, so we want a short and aggressive brake zone. We can't trail brake with much pressure because the downhill makes it easy to lose the rear.

We want to trail off, even have a bit of coast if we need. Initial throttle only at or even a little after the apex. Use all the road at corner exit.

### Turn 2

Turn 2 is all about trying to roll entry speed to limit the amount of time spent at maitenance throttle. The second most important thing is trying to work back to full throttle as early as possible.

We want to turn in from the inside and bring in enough entry speed so the car brings us about a half car width to one car width off the inside.

Coming back to apex the start of the apex curb and trying to work back to full throttle not long after the apex.

### Turn 4

Basically a kink leading onto a short straight down to turn four, with both a blind apex and drift out point.

Accelerating very hard in the bottom of the dip look up to the top of the rise towards the apex, still drive hard up the rise. In most cars this is flat, but slowly work up to it. It may not be flat in your car so start off the weekend BEFORE you crest the hill. From there slowly work on adding speed.

### Turn 5

This is the biggest brake zone on the race track and the best overtaking spot. The brake zone drops steeply downhill so it is very easy to lock up here. We typically want to brake hard just before the road really starts to drop downhill and then immediately start releasing off of brake pressure to not luck up or get to heavy into abs.

Once again our focus here is on getting back to full throttle as early as possible after the apex - it can be difficult to put the power down.

We want really slow hands at turn in here so that we can roll in entry speed. This almost works out to sort of be a double apex. We typically want enough entry speed so that we can trail brake past the first apex and have the car bring us just a third of a car width off the curb.

That is where we want the rotation to happen and only as we get the car heading back towards the apex do we want to get back to throttle.

### Turn 7 - 8

Turn 7 is all about entry speed, if you can pick up the throttle at the apex you have over slowed. We want to work on really slow hands hear and coming off heavy brake pressure to roll in the speed.

Getting your eyes up is absolutely critical here. We want to open our hands as early as possible so that we track out and can get our hands straight before going over the big curb in-between 7 and 8. We should not need to get back to throttle here.

After we go across the curb we hesitate just for a tiny amount of time before turning down into turn 8. Again here it is all about slow hands and patience. Make sure you get your eyes up and you start to unwind the steering wheel as early as possible so you can work back to full throttle as soon as you can.

When this is done right you should be out all the way track left just before the exit curb even starts.

### Turns 9 and 10

This is the very fast chicane and the important part of this section is speed into 9 and getting back to full throttle out of 10.

These corners will very a TON depending on what car you are driving. Some need to brake, some will just have a lift and some will be close to flat - this sectiond differs more than almost any other section on any race track. So, slowly work up to this section, work backwards.

Start your weekend off by getting back to full throttle at the apex of 10 and slowly build up more and more speed through 9 until you can't get back to full throttle where you want to. Then just bring the speed down a tiny amount in 9.

### Turns 11 and 12

This section is FUN! It is all about entry speed here and using the uphill to slow the car down.

We want to turn in so that we apex the start of the curb at turn 11 but we want enough entry speed so that we are trail braking past this first apex. The long trail brake helps you rotate the car and keep it left before turning into turn 12.

In turn 12 you really have two choices:

1. Put nearly your entire car on the curb

2. Don't use the curb at all

Try both and see which works better for you. The important thing here is trying to work back to full throttle as early as possible (this may not be possible before the crest in high horsepower cars)

### Turn 13 and 14

Turn 13 is all about entry speed. We want to place the entire car on the apex curb in the dip, we gain a ton of grip here as the road compresses.

We want enough speed after this where the car slowly takes us further and further left. Ideally we can open our hands ever so slightly before braking for turn 14 so that we can brake slightly deeper.

This section is extremely difficult because there are absolutely no reference points and 13 is a very long corner, it is really easy to get lost in here. The best thing we can do is be very disciplined with our eyes and look through 13 to try and find the apex at turn 14 as early as possible.

We want a light long trail brake here and we look to apex the start of the apex curb. Making sure we trail brake all the way down to the apex to get the extra rotation so we can get back to full throttle in-between 14 and 15.

### Turn 15

Turn 15 is all about getting back to full throttle as early as possible. It is an akward corner as it isn't really a brake and it's downhill so it can be difficult to get the weight on the nose to get the car rotated enough.

Timing your lift to come right at turn in can help with rotation. Get your eyes up and use every little bit of the road at corner exit.
