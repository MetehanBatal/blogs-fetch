Hey everyone, [Coach Dion](https://blayze.io/coach/dion-von-moltke) is here with another coaching race tip in under 60 seconds!

Do you have a corner where you always feel lost? I know I do! The issue almost always comes down to your vision and a lack of having all [five reference points](https://blayze.io/blog/5-reference-points-for-every-corner-on-the-race-track) located in that specific corner.

Every corner has five reference points. **We will cover them going backward:**

1. Exit Apex
2. Apex
3. Slow Point of the Corner
4. Turn In
5. Brake Point.

We need to make sure exactly where all five reference points are in every corner.

## Break Down of a Corner’s Reference Points

Let us use Turn 3 at [Virginia International Raceway](https://blayze.io/blog/top-3-mistakes-at-virginia-international-raceway) (VIR).

This is a very common corner where racers feel lost.

What is an Exit Apex? It is simply where you get the car out the widest. It is a very specific point.

Watch as I point out all 5 reference points in the video at the top of this article.

Use the image below as a guide for where all your reference points are at Turn 3. Making a visual cue like this for every corner at the track is a great exercise to try. If you make one, be sure to share it and tag us on social so we can give feedback!

I know where all five of these points are located BEFORE entering the corner.

Then I have to have the right timing of when I move my vision from one to the next.

So, if you are feeling lost in the corner, it is likely down to your [vision on the track](https://blayze.io/blog/vision-on-the-racetrack). Start there and work off from that!
