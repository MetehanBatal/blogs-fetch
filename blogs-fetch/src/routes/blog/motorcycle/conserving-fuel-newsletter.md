Hey Racers welcome to the Blayze racing newsletter where every week you will get an answer to a racing question you ponder about after every session, a video will make your jaw drop, and one article that will change your racing life in one simple email. 

So, let's wave this green flag and get right into it.  Oh and if you aren't a subscriber yet but need this in your life just enter your details below!

## How do you conserve fuel but keep turning fast lap times?

When we ask most racers how they conserve fuel, we usually hear two answers:
1. Short shift
2. Run a higher gear


But, are those the best ways to actually conserve fuel? 

When we studied this with engineers in pro racing we found that those are actually not very efficient ways to save fuel and they commonly result in too much time loss. So, what are pro drivers doing?

Historically, the lift and coast approach has been the favorite amongst pro drivers.

The lift and coast technique is where lift off the throttle much earlier than normal heading into a brake zone, coast (0% throttle and not braking) for a while, and then actually brake deeper than they normally do.

But, recently engineers in pro racing have found an adaptation of the traditional "lift and coast" that saves almost the same amount of fuel but results in faster lap times. They call it the partial lift and coast (no one has ever accused engineers with coming up with good nicknames).

How does this work? Well... it's pretty much like it sounds.

As you approach the braking zone, rather than doing a full lift down to 0% throttle and coasting before attacking the brakes. A driver will actually start lifting even earlier but rather than lifting down to 0% they will lift down to ~20% throttle. They will then carry that 20% throttle much deeper into the corner.

This results in faster lap times and a similar amount of fuel save. [Check out the full video on this technique here](https://youtu.be/55xpr_Uj7tY).

## Article of the week: How do I develop "feel" on track?

![developing feel on the race track](https://blayze.io/assets/images/blogs/car-racing/chris-hristovunsplash.jpg)

"Feel" is a word that isn't spoken about enough in racing. It's that feel that allows us to work our way up to the limit and know what our vehicle needs from us to go faster.

We all want more feel, but how do we actually improve it? Find out how from Blayze coach Ken Hill [here](https://blayze.io/blog/motorcycle/developing-feel-on-the-race-track).



## Video of the week: Onboard with Mike Skeen for a restart in the wet

Check out this fantastic example of experimenting with lines in the wet.  Notice Mike goes off the racing line through turn 14 on the restart and has a TON of grip compared to those around him.


Then in turn 1 and turn 3 he's on the racing line.  In turn 5 he shows a great example of crossing over the rubbered line at corner exit.  Lots of great things we can learn from Mike here and also just a lot of fun to watch!
