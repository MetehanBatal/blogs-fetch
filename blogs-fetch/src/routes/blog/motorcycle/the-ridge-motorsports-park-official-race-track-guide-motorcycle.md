### The Ridge Motorsports Park Race Track Notes

The Ridge is a hidden gem in the racetrack world. Set among the trees in Western WA, this track offers huge elevation changes, blind entries and exits, as well as smooth grippy pavement. The track has a little bit of everything, a long front straight, 2 very slow corners and a lot of time on the side of the tire.
