When Zoe was on the U17 World Cup team, in the semi-finals she missed her PK and the US did not go through to the final. She decided that she would never miss her PK again and spent three years taking at least one PK shot every practice. When she found herself at the U20 World Cup qualifiers again, this time she made her PK and helped the US through to the Finals.
