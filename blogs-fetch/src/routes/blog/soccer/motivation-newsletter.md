<h3>**Question of the Week: Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivation?**</h3>

Playing with confidence is more mental than physical. Confident players can be unstoppable at times.üö´

How can you build your confidence? Do you know what intrinsically and extrinsically motivate you? Or are you scratching your head and thinking ‚Äì what the heck are you talking about?

Improving your confidence comes down to figuring out your intrinsic and extrinsic motivators. üß†

Intrinsic motivation is doing something because it brings you joy and happiness. üòÅ

Extrinsic motivation is doing something based on meeting or obtaining a goal, reward, or praise from others. üèÜ

Yes, athletes should be able to identify their individual intrinsic AND extrinsic motivators.

Steps to Identify and Improve on Your own:

1. Take 5 minutes to sit and write out all the reasons you play the game of soccer.
2. Look at your list and identify each reason as either an intrinsic or extrinsic motivator.
3. Remember it is okay for players to be both intrinsically and extrinsically motivated.

‚öΩIntrinsic motivation is typically more valuable because players always perform at a high level when they are playing the game to have fun and for the joy and happiness of being out on the field and playing a sport they love.

‚öΩExtrinsic motivation is important as well because teams will always get more out of the individual when each player is bought in and working towards a common goal (ex. winning the conference or division or winning a trophy at a tournament)
