Hey guys, Blayze soccer coach Mike is back with another “Skills in 60 Seconds”. Today we will talk about staying committed to the play. Let’s do this!

Our example will come from Gareth Bale’s first goal in his MLS career. We will talk about why he is a special player and what you can learn from him.

In the clip we see Bale pick up the ball in his half and immediately sprint forward to join the attack. By doing so, he puts himself in a 1v1 situation. We know players like this can be deadly, especially in the MLS.

As we watch this clip, what makes it special is Bale’s commitment to stay involved in the play. Take a quick look at the reactions from his three teammates who have the possibility of joining this attack.

All three players completely stopped their run and give up on the play.

But Bale stays committed. He started his run from his half and rewards himself with his hard work and commitment to get forward putting himself in the 1v1 situation.

Do not give up on the play. Be the player that sprints forward on the field and creates opportunities out of nothing. That is what makes players like Gareth Bale so special and that can make you special as well.

Thanks for joining in everyone!
