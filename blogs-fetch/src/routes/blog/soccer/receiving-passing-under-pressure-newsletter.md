## What is the best way to practice receiving + passing quickly under pressure?



The best way to practice receiving and passing under pressure on your own is to go find a wall or surface to pass against.

A flat or rough cement wall is going to be your best friend - you want something that constantly delivers the ball back to you in a way that felt like receiving a pass from a teammate. Focused repetition on how to strike the ball with different parts of the foot in order to receive the ball back in different ways allows you to explore different passing and receiving techniques, which translates well to competition.

The average American youth soccer player probably gets around 200-400 touches on the ball in an entire week of team training. Individual training with a ball and a wall can help you produce an extra 200-400 touches on the ball in a week. Imagine being able to get twice as many reps compared to the average player?? Talk about an advantage ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯

There are so many ways to progress wall ball drills and add different focuses in the passing or receiving phases.

For passing accuracy, try adding a target on the wall with chalk, like a square to try to deliver your passes into. Put one low for ground passes and another at about chest or head level for driven balls or crosses and shots.

For receiving, try adding cones or stakes on the ground behind you that you turn or take your first touch towards to mimic pressure from the opponent in the game. Ultimately, it comes down to getting as many individual touches as you can in a week and making those repetitions feel like what it feels like at training or in your games.

The truth is that we all learn in different ways and we all have to work on different parts of our games. That's why at Blayze we focus on individual training to supplement team training. Our [Blayze+ members](https://blayze.io/blayze-plus) get custom weekly training plans so you can know exactly what to work on.

Every single athlete feels anxiety and nerves before a match. Our body actually has tools that we can use to turn these usually negative emotions into positive ones.

It's the athletes that know about these tools and learn how to use these tools correctly that tend to succeed on game days. At Blayze all of our coaches spend an extensive amount of time working with their athletes on the mental aspects of the game.

In this week's article Blayze coach, [Mike Semenza](https://blayze.io/coach/mike-semenza), breaks down how he coaches athletes to handle pre-game emotions by focusing on visualizing and their breathing.
