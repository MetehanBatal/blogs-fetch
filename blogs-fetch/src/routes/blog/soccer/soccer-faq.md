## Who are the coaches?

We believe the only way to learn is to ensure you are working with the very best coaches in the world. We founded Blayze with the goal of making it more affordable and accessible for anyone to learn personally from those coaches. 

So, when you come to Blayze for coaching you can be sure that you will be working with the best minds in sports coaching. Not only have they competed at the top levels of their sports, they have a unique ability to communicate complex and technical things in a way that is easy to understand for all age groups and skill levels and actually make the changes you need!



## Is Blayze a conflict with my team coach?

Coaches at Blayze take the time to learn more about your teams head coach and what they want out of you. 

Head coaches often are focused on the entire team and don't have the time to dive deep 1 on 1 with every player and that is where Blayze coaches come in. Every coach at Blayze is focused entirely on you. They take the time to learn about your strengths, weaknesses, your technique, physical ability, and mental toughness. They take all of that and create custom training programs and personalized video analysis coaching sessions just for you based on your game film or training videos. 

This allows Blayze coaches to supplemental to your in-person coaches and not a conflict at all.



## Can I select a specific Blayze coach to work with?

Absolutely! You can select any coach you want to work with or if you need help we can select one of our world-class coaches for you.



## What video should I upload to my coach?

You can upload game film or training film! For training film Blayze will show you exactly what drills to run through and how to film for your first technique analysis. If you want to upload game film you can upload video from any camera or share links to your video on Veo or Hudl if you have them! 



## How long until I receive my coaching session?

Our coaches aim to turn around coaching sessions within 48 hours.



## How do I film myself?

You can use any camera to record yourself working through any drill. Our coaches just want to ensure they can see your entire body as you run through it. Most athletes just prop up their phone or have a friend film them from their phone. 

Do you have game film from a Hudl, Veo, or any other camera types? If so, you can absolutely upload that too!



## What camera should I use?

Any camera! You can upload video from your phone, go-pro, Hudl, Veo or from any other video camera or video analysis platform.



## Is my coaching session secure?

Yes! Only you will see your coaching video unless you decide you would like to share them.



## How do I know if I'm ready for a Blayze coach?

When you work with the very best coaches they will tailor their coaching to your experience level. So, it doesn't matter if it's your first day playing a new sport or you have been playing for 20 years, our coaches can help you! Perfect for players of all ages, experience levels, and interest levels. It doesnâ€™t matter if you want to play in college or the pros one day or if you just want to beat your friend and rival, our coaches are here for you.
