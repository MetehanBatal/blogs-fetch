## How to Win More Headers

Headers, or hitting the ball out of the air with your head, is a frequently overlooked skill in soccer.

Maybe this has to do with the fact that headers are not coached very well in the U.S. Also, children 10 and under are not allowed to head the ball in any games or practices, per the soccer governing bodies in America.

If you are new to soccer or are learning how to head the ball, it is important to remember that it takes a bit of time for your neck muscles to build. These muscles increase your ability to put speed, power, and direction on the ball.

Headers often require the player to jump and/or manipulate their body to use their head to pass, shot, or clear the ball.

Winning more headers requires you to learn how to ATTACK the ball in the air.

First, let us practice the basics.

Take your ball and toss it in the air or kick it off a wall. Use your hips, body, and neck to load back and snap forward while you head the ball standing still. Focus on connecting your forehead to the ball.

If you are new to this skill, it is normal to take a few hits to the face. Or to completely miss the ball. This is why it is important to work on keeping your eyes on the ball.

Once you are comfortable heading the ball standing still, let’s add jumping. This challenges your coordination and timing. Sometimes it can help to have a teammate toss the ball in the air for you.

It is not easy, so take your time. Try not to get frustrated.

- Friendly Tip: Keep your mouth shut while heading the ball. This will help you avoid clattering your teeth or biting your tongue. Ouch!!*

In a game scenario, not all headers will be from a standing position. You may need to head the ball on a run. In addition, you will probably be blocking defenders away from you so that you can jump and meet the ball. Sounds simple right?

Remember, the player with the best positioning of where to meet the ball typically wins the header. Anticipate the flight of the ball, get to your spot avoiding any defenders, and be the first to jump and “attack”.

Now get out there and start practicing!
