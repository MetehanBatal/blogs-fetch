## Question of the Week: How much sleep do I need?

Most parents and players know that a good night of sleep😴 is critical for a solid performance the next day. But how much sleep is enough the night before a game?

You don’t want to sleep too much. And you don’t want to sleep too little!

Getting the right amount of sleep the night before a game is extremely important and is a huge factor in your performance the next day.😎

Sometimes athletes can oversleep or under sleep the night before a game. Both can have negative😲 impacts on your performance. Oversleeping and under sleeping can leave you tired and sore the next day.

A good time to shoot for is a minimum of 6-8 hours of sleep.👍 Typically, anything under 6 hours or over 8 hours will leave you too tired for the game, and you may notice your focus and determination might be low.

Getting these hours is important. But you also want to make sure the quality of your sleep is high too.🌛

To improve your sleep quality, make sure the temperature 🌡of your room is comfortable. Turn your lights💡 off as soon as possible so your eyes can relax.

Do not look at your phone 📴or any other screens the hour before you fall asleep. Try some deep breathing exercises as you lay on your back.🧘‍♀️

Have a tall glass of water🥤 next to your bed in case you get thirsty in the middle of the night.

Use your imagination to see yourself playing in the game the next day and helping your team win the game.🥇

Remember, get to bed🛌 early so you have time to relax and fall into a deep sleep. Dream about your upcoming game and what you are going to do individually to help your team win.
