## How to become a better striker?

Being a striker is no easy task. It is one of the most difficult positions to play on the field. It can be one of the most rewarding positions as well. Strikers play a key role in the attack for their team. Their main responsibility is scoring goals.

So how can you become a better striker for your team?

A striker can become more deadly by improving their movement off the ball. The timing of those movements and the ability to score from different areas in and around the 18-yard box. Improving your movement off the ball and the timing of those movements comes with experience. Watching your game film or game film of a professional striker is a terrific way to learn about what kind of movements those strikers perform and when they perform them. See if they are effective or not and then go deeper and try to answer what about the movement or timing of their movement made it effective.

Did they put themselves in an advantageous position to make a play on the ball? If so, how was their finishing technique? Did they use their instep or laces? Did they jump to win a header? Did they take a long-range shot? Did they use their right or left foot?

It does not matter how the ball goes in the net, as long as it goes in!

Get out on the field and start working on shooting from different areas of the 18-yard box. Try from straight on, from side angles, or off the volley. If you have a friend to train with, one can cross the ball into the box from a wide area and the other can work on scoring from a cross. You can both learn how movements and the timing of those movements impact the ability to place the ball in the back of the net.
