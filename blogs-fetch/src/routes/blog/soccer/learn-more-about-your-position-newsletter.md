## How to Learn More About Your Position?

Learning more about your position comes down to studying the game as much as you can. There are many ways to study the game. Some of our favorite ways include watching your performances on film or watching the performance of players you admire on film. Then get feedback and answers to your questions from experienced coaches.

Never be afraid to ask questions about your position and the expectations of players in that position on the field. If you never ask questions, you will never find the answers. This might impact your performance and your ability to help the team.

When watching game film, focus on how that player was able to have an impact on the game. Was it their speed while dribbling? Passing ability? Movements off the ball? Leadership through [communication](https://blayze.io/blog/soccer/how-to-improve-communication-for-soccer-players)?

Think about the traits and abilities players have that allow them to be so effective in their position on the field. While watching film, always take the approach of focusing on what you did well, what you could have done better and how you plan to work on fixing the mistakes you made when you play in your next game.

Different players bring different impacts to the team in multiple ways.
