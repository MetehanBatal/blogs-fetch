Hey everyone! [Coach Mike](https://blayze.io/coach/mike-semenza) here with Blayze Soccer bringing you a list of the 10 best individual drills to work on at home for your upcoming spring tryouts.

These are the five fundamental technical abilities for defenders, [midfielders](https://blayze.io/blog/soccer/top-drill-for-midfielders-and-attackers-in-soccer), and forwards broken into five focus areas with two drills each. If a player can build these skills in their [individual training](https://blayze.io/blog/general/benefits-of-one-on-one-coaching), they will be well prepared for their upcoming tryouts.

All of these drills can be performed with a ball, a few cones, and a flat surface to pass the ball off on. If you have a goal to shoot on, great! If not, find creative ways to make a shooting target.

For more drills, our coaches can also help you put together weekly personalized training plans tailored to your specific needs. Check out [Blayze+](https://blayze.io/blayze-plus) for more details!
