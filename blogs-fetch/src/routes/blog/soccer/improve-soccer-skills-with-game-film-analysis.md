“Teams don’t learn. Individuals within the team learn. Development is a personal process. Even when conducted in a team environment.” – Johan Cruyff

As games and tournaments start, maybe you find yourself not getting as much game time as you like. Your practices are going well. You give it 100%, but you do not seem to be standing out within the game as you thought you would. You need to improve your gameplay fast, but how?

Imagine if your coach was able to sit you down after every game and discuss your performance on a one-to-one basis. What kind of insights could your coach give you? What are you doing well? What do you need to work on?

How fast could you improve your gameplay if you had this type of frequent, direct feedback?

Now snap back to reality.

Most likely your team coach cannot provide this level of development. They simply do not have the time to focus on each individual player. And that’s okay! Their job is to focus on the team and how to improve the team as a whole.

It is your job to seek improvement outside of your team.

How much time and energy do you need to spend with a private coach to get this type of feedback? How much money do you have to invest?

It can truly be frustrating trying to identify the best way to get quality, honest feedback, and develop a plan on how to improve your skills.

Here at Blayze – we have the **exact** solution you need!

## Game Film Analysis

Did you know that [65% of people](https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/dissertations/AAI22589668/) are visual learners? That means when your coach gives feedback to you or your team, the majority of the players are missing the coach’s message. Sometimes coaches use whiteboards to doodle out plays. This may help, but direct feedback on performance is hard to mark up on a board.

Studies indicate that when a player is shown a video of a game error, it helps that player catch on faster and is less likely to repeat the error in future games. This is why nearly all high-performing teams use film analysis for games and training.

Game film is a recording of a game, sometimes training, to allow for analysis afterward. Most coaches and clubs use game film to break down why a play did not work, analyze how the team worked together, and identify any errors that need improvement.

### Memory Recall

While a game is going on, it is difficult for players to know exactly what is happening at all times. Players rarely remember every single play of the entire game. A lot of times, some players may assume they played better than they did or could.

When you can remove the emotion and adrenaline of the game and see what happened, there is a higher chance of you being able to correct any errors. The change in perspective also helps you to see how your actions on the field interact with your teammates.

A recent [study](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/24748668.2008.11868424#:~:text=The results of the current,Franks and Miller (1986).) indicated that experienced coaches accurately recall about 59.2% of a game while novice coaches only recall around 17.2%. That is a lot of forgotten information. Video analysis can help in memory recall and put data to good use.

Blayze soccer coach, and Chicago Red Stars defender Zoe Morse, has first-hand experience with how important game film analysis is to improving as a player:

"I've spent hundreds of hours throughout my career sitting down with my coaches going over filming and talking through specific scenarios. This has helped me increase my awareness on the field and ultimately make better decisions on and off the ball. Like many players, I didn't have access to a coach that had the time to do this with me until I reached college, and regret not having focused on studying film sooner. I've seen how much it has helped my game and career since then.”

### Removes Bias and Bad Habits

With review and analysis, you can level up your gameplay by watching game films. Players very often misremember their actions during a game. You may develop misconceptions in your head about how you play. You do one thing but need to be doing another, simply because you are not remembering the game properly.

With game film analysis, the emotion and excitement of the game disappear. This leads to more productive conversations about your skill and how you interact with the team. It can inform you on what strategies you used and help you make better decisions in future games. You can also compare your skills to your teammates or the opponents and learn where you excel and where you can improve.

But the trick is to use a coach to provide the analysis and pinpoint bad habits. Players cannot analyze themselves.

### Helps Prevent Injury

Using your body correctly helps avoid injuries. Nearly 1.35 million young athletes suffered a serious injury in [2012](http://www.safekids.org/research-report/game-changers-stats-stories-and-what-communities-are-doing-protect-young-athletes). This equals one trip to the emergency room every 25 seconds because of a youth sport. Poor technique and body positioning is a leading cause of sports-related injuries.

When you watch yourself in game film, you can identify if you are using techniques incorrectly that may cause pain or injury. Correcting these bad habits and learning proper techniques will help you avoid future injuries.

## Why Are Teams Not Using Game Film Analysis?

Unfortunately, not all coaches use game film to help improve the team. Not all clubs and teams can afford the big fancy cameras and monthly memberships. Even if one nice family purchases the camera, not everyone within the team can pay for the services to get the game film analyzed.

Many coaches want to use game film, but they simply do not have the time. Think about your club coach. How many teams does she/he coach? If it is only one, then maybe they do have the time. But typical club coaches oversee 3 or more teams every season.

Even if the coach does have time for game film analysis, the coach will rarely sit an individual player down to focus on their sole role within the game. The coach gathers the entire team to discuss bigger-picture plays and tactics.

Yes, these types of corrections and learning opportunities found in game analysis help separate a team that performs well from a really good team.

## Blayze and Game Film Analysis

One of the many amazing things we provide here at Blayze is game film analysis! This is how our coaches know exactly what to work on for you as a player. It is the “secret” to our amazing private training programs.

By watching your game film, the Blayze professional coaches analyze your individual and team playing style. From there, they can work with you by pinpointing what you are doing well within a game. They also help to design a training plan focused on your goals, paired with areas you need to work on to improve your performance.

Blayze coaches can help to identify bad habits, bad techniques, quality movement, and growth opportunities. All simply from watching your game film!

Even if you find a quality private coach, they most likely do not spend any time on game film. You spend your hours running drills, but with little direction toward improving your game performance.

With Blayze, you can upload your game film to your selected private coach, and he/she will analyze it for you. Then they will set up a time that is convenient for you to sit down and go over their findings. From there, you two will work together to develop a plan of improvement and goal setting. It truly is amazing.

### But What Type of Footage Should I Upload?

This is a very common question we get here at Blayze. Many parents and players are not sure what type of game footage is considered “quality” for a coach to analyze.

The answer: any type of footage!

You may only play 20 minutes of the first half of a game. Upload that!

You may only touch the ball a few times the entire second half of a game. Upload that!

Maybe you found the game to be boring or slow? Upload it!

You may be surprised at what coaches can see that players and parents do not. Even if the game seemed slow or boring with little action, Blayze coaches can find various discussion points on what your player is doing well and where they can improve.

It could be simple field positioning as to why the player did not receive the ball often. Or another reason that a Blayze coach can identify.

How long should the video be? Anything 10 minutes or more is quality footage.

If you have access to VEO or Huddl film, you can upload the links directly.

Otherwise, you can take the video with your phone or video recorder.

Highlight reels are fine, but there is a lot that can be learned from errors and mistakes as well!
