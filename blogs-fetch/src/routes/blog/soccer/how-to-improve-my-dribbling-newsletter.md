## How to Become a Better Dribbler?

Many soccer players want to become faster when they dribble the ball. Players need to be able to dribble at all different speeds and in all different directions. Think of it as a 360-degree ability.

Keep your training simple when focusing on improving your dribbling. Start on an open field and get comfortable moving in every direction while keeping the ball close to your body.

If you have cones or markers available, you can place those on the ground and work on avoiding them by switching the direction of your dribble. Try stopping the ball first, then try to move past the cone(s) or markers without stopping.

If you have a friend to train with, make them try to win the ball off you defensively while you dribble. Work on keeping the ball close to your body but also away from the defenders‚Äô feet. Or you can try taking turns dribbling and passing to each other or dribbling and shooting on goal.

Try to get comfortable manipulating the ball with different surfaces of your feet at different speeds and in different directions. Once you feel more comfortable with the ball, make sure you are also focusing on getting your head and eyes up to scan the field. Dribbling while seeing the field will allow you to make better split-second decisions during games. Make sure you are picking the correct times to dribble versus maybe passing to a teammate or shooting the ball.

Dribbling should always be fun!
