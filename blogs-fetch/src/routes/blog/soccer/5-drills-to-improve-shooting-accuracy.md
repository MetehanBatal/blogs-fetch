## Shooting Drills

### 1. 1v1 Quick Touch to Shot - Right Foot to Left Side Goal & Left Foot to Right Side Of Goal

This drill will help to improve your ball control in tight spaces inside the 18-yard-box and shot placement.  Focus on staying tall while engaging the cones. Make a fast lateral cut to the side and quickly deliver a shot into the far corner of the goal. The objective here is to be able to hit the same corner of the goal consistently.

### 2. Angled Roll to Shot Back Post - Right and Left foot

You will work on the accuracy of your instep striking/shooting ability. Focus on your footwork approaching the ball. Aim your plant foot at the far corner or back post of the goal. Follow through with both your hips and upper body as you strike/shoot the ball. This will generate a spin or curve on the ball. The purpose here is to become a deadly finisher from outside the 18 yd box.

### 3. Angled Roll to Shot Near Post - Right and Left foot

This drill helps with the accuracy of your instep striking/shooting ability. Focus on your footwork approaching the ball. Aim your plant foot at the near corner or near post of the goal. Follow through with both your hips and upper body as you strike/shoot the ball to generate a spin or curve on the ball. Another technique to become a deadly finisher from outside the 18 yd box.

### 4. Pass, Move and Shoot - Right and Left foot

Here we want to work on the timing of your approach and the total body mechanics you use to shoot the ball accurately with one touch, into the far corner or back post. Focus on getting around the cone at speed. Use good footwork when approaching the ball and check your body orientation as you shoot and follow through with your whole body to generate spin/curve and power. All strikers and midfielders need to be able to shoot the ball with one touch.

### 5. Toss to Volley Near Post - Right and Left foot

This drill helps to improve your ability to strike a ball out of the air or off the bounce while focusing on accurately delivering the ball with your laces to the near post. Focus on keeping your eyes on the flight or path of the ball, your timing to approach the ball to shoot, and locking your ankle while pointing your toe down to generate a clean, linear powerful volley. Remember, the ball will not always come to you on the ground in the games, so you need to practice volleys out of the air!
