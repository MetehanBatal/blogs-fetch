## Question of the Week: How Do I Become a Better Shooter?

A new soccer season is right around the corner. Our coaches here at Blayze know you all are looking to hit the pitch with your best foot forward.ðŸ¦¶

This week letâ€™s break down how to become a better shooter. No matter what position you play, you never know when you will have the opportunity to shoot on ðŸ¥… goal.

Shooting is striking the ball at the goal with the intention of scoring. Every good shot either hits the back of the net or forces the goalkeeper or defenders to make a save or a block. Becoming a better shooter comes down to being able to control both your shot power and your shot placement. ðŸŽ¯

Getting more comfortable with locking your ankle and striking the ball with different surfaces of your feet is the best way to improve shot power. The

[laces](https://www.blayze.io/blog/soccer/60-second-soccer-skills-striking-with-your-laces) of your feet will always generate more power on a shot. The instep or inside of your feet might not produce as much power.

But, using your instep or inside of the feet often leads to more controlled and well-placed shots.ðŸ¥…

Get out and try shooting with both your laces and the inside of your foot. Work on adding control to your shots with the laces of your feet by focusing on where your plant foot is landing and how you are shaping the foot that is shooting the âš½ ball.

Remember to keep your eyes ðŸ‘€ down while shooting so you can focus on the ball and your technique. When using the instep or inside of the feet to shoot the ball, try adding a little extra power, spin, or curve to the ball. This will help you in adding even more control of the ball when needing to shoot from different angles or with defenders in the way.

Start by shooting balls that are sitting still on the ground, like a free kick. Once you feel comfortable doing that, try dribbling and shooting from different angles.

If you have a friend or sibling that can play goalkeeper thatâ€™s great! Even if you do not have one, getting repetitions shooting in front of a goal is super important and should always be fun as well! ðŸ˜Ž
