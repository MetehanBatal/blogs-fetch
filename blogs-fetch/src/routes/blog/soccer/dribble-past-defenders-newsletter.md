## Question of the Week: How to Dribble Past Defenders?

Do you want to leave defenders wishing they never had to mark you? 🤔Then follow along!

Dribbling is more about decision-making and less about being fancy!⭐

Dribbling past defenders is all about making rapid decisions before and after you receive the ball in a game. Sometimes the less fancy you try to be, the more players you can beat on the dribble.

Doing so requires you to use your [vision](https://blayze.io/blog/soccer/vision-in-soccer) 👀 and body control to identify where teammates and defenders are on the field. And where the best spot to position yourself.

Receiving the ball ⚽with less pressure is always a good way to start your dribble to beat the defender. Once you decide to try to take a player on by dribbling, use your vision to decide where you want to bring the ball.

Use different speeds 🏃‍♀️to get there so that the defender is forced to make more reactions. Only use skill moves if you see them necessary to get into the space. Otherwise, the simpler you can keep it, the higher chance you have of beating players when dribbling.

How do I improve on my own:

1. Work on simple dribbling drills. Focus more on getting your eyes 👀up so you can see what’s happening around you.
2. Work on sharp changes of direction with the ball around cones or dribbling at your teammates in training. This might require you to use different surfaces of your feet🦶 to push the ball in different directions.
3. Work on dribbling at different speeds and changing speeds rapidly while you dribble. This might require using different parts of your feet.
4. Work on mastering 1 or 2 [skill moves](https://blayze.io/blog/soccer/step-over) or tricks to fool defenders when you need it.
