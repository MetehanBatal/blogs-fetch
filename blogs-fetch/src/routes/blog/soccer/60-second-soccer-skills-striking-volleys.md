Hey guys, it is coach Mike with Blayze Soccer back with another “Skills in 60 Seconds”. Today we will talk about striking the ball on a volley or hitting a volley.

First, you must keep your eyes on the ball at all times. This is so you can read the flight of the ball and adjust as needed. You need to get to the exact spot where the ball will drop.

Second, keep your feet moving. As you are watching the ball, take small steps to adjust your feet quickly. This will get you into the best position possible to make a clean strike on the ball.

Finally, you want to get your body to face the goal. You need to get your hips around and point to the spot you want the ball to go. Wrapping your hips around the ball will generate the power. Rotate your plant foot as you strike the ball and point it at the target.

If you focus on these three components, you will have a clean volley each time.

Get out to a field and start working on these three components. Toss the ball in the air. Keep your eyes on the ball. Set your feet and hips to wrap through the ball. Repeat. Don’t forget to practice using both feet. You never know which side you will need to take the volley.
