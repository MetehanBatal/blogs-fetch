### The Takeaways From The Braking Fundamentals Webinar

In pretty much any corner that has a real braking zone we want to focus on two main points:

- Our initial brake pressure should be our peak brake pressure in that braking zone.
- We don't want to touch the throttle until we are ready to unwind the steering wheel.

These two points are the foundations of good braking technique and this is what we build trail braking around. By focusing on just two points early on we also limit the variables to our brake zone which makes it easier to build in consistency and we can't really improve until we are consistent.

Once you have built in this consistency we can start to concentrate on learning to trail brake and rolling in more entry speed. When you get to this point you will be concentrating on increasing your entry speed and for most drivers the first thing they want to do is brake deeper.

This is actually the very last thing we want to do! To roll in more entry speed we first want to focus on the middle to backend of the braking zone. We want to work on getting that hard hit of the initial brakes and as soon as possible work off that heavy brake pressure.

That reduction of brake pressure is how we can roll in more entry speed while actually extending our braking all the way to the apex.

When drivers try to roll in more entry speed by braking deeper we typically see one major flaw happen. As we work to go deeper our anxiety rises, as that anxiety rises our eyes lower. We stare at that braking marker and we don't have our eyes up looking at the apex. By the time we get our eyes back to our apex it is too late and we have over slowed.

Have you experienced that? I know both Andrew & I have. There is a place for braking deeper, but we need to pair that with perfect braking technique, so make braking deeper the last step of the process you work on. It's not only faster but it is safer as well.
