## Dominion Raceway Race Track Notes



This track is pretty tight and can be intimidating with some concrete walls very close, but it is a fun lap for some track days.



### 1) Ease Into A Late Brake Zone Into Turn 1

The main straight is quite fast with a heavy braking zone into T1. Use caution as there isn't a lot of runoff.



### 2) Focus On Rolling Speed Through Turns 2 - 8

The "infield" from Turns 2-8 is pretty tight, but has a good flow to it. Because there aren't really straights in this portion, focus on maintaining speed.



### 3) Focus On Exit Speed Out Of Turn 9

At Turn 9, switch your focus to exit speed to get a good run through the Big Esses.



### 4) Use The Grip The Uphill Apex In Turn 15 Provides

Compress the brake zone at T15 and carry entry speed into the uphill apex, which has a lot of grip. Just be careful because it tightens at the track out.



### 5) Beware Of Bumps

Finally, be careful over the bumps into the last corner and get a good run onto the main straight.
