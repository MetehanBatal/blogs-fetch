Watkins Glen International Raceway is known as one of the very best race tracks in the world. It is high speed, technical and very difficult. In this weeks [#PickYourCorner](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23PickYourCorner) competition our winner, John, asked us to break down this video of him driving through the Bus Stop.

For our #PickYourCorner competition we pick one winner, have them send us the video of them driving at the corner they hate the most.  We break it down in 60 seconds or less and give our analysis! Check out this weeks winner, John!
