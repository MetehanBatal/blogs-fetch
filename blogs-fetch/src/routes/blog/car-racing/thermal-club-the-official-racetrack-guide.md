## Thermal Club Race Track Notes



#### 1) Exit Speed

This track offers many layouts and corner types. Be sure to prioritize exit speed for the corners that lead onto straights by using late apexes in order to straighten the car and get back to power early.



#### 2) Focus On Min Speeds

For corners that are linked together or have short straights following, focus on straightening the line as much as possible to keep the minimum speed up as best as possible. 



#### 3) Use All Of The Road

The paved runoff makes this track quite safe, so don't be afraid to use the full width of the marked track surface--don't make the track any narrower than it needs to be!
