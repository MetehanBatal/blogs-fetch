For a racecar driver to be fast, they have to be able to adapt their driving to different situations, and do adapt well they have to completently understand how every single input they make affects the balance of the racecar."}

The brake zone is the first opportunity we have to affect the weight transfer of the racecar which is so important to how the car handles. In this lesson Joef breaksdown how to perfect our braking technique."}

But, what does that actually mean? How do we know if our eyes are up and looking far enough ahead? Here Josef Newgarden explains what 'eyes up' means to him and how he focuses on his vision."}

To know how to time our throttle application we need to understand how our feet and hands need work together."}
  - {track_id: "4", playback_id: "CG8MNQ6wu9F01lXhjO8sTJnBosqmdn7rLWtNCxgpYXjs",  lesson_name: "Understanding Weight Transfer", lesson_desc: "As we have learnt so far with Josef as racecar driver we need to be able to adapt our driving to get the most out of the car. But, to be able to correctly adapt we need to deeply understand how weight transfer works and what shifting the weight does to the cars grip. Here Josef explains what you need to know about weight transfer."}
