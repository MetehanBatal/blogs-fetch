## Virginia International Raceway Race Track Notes

### Turn 1

A good initial brake point can be at the beginning of the brake markers on the left hand side, eventually we want to bring this down to around the 500 board depending on your car. This should be a 2nd or 3rd gear corner depending on your car. Our aim here is to have a decently early turn in as there isn’t much grip here and hold the apex for a little while. We want to apex at the start of the couloured curb and have our right front tire up on the grey car. Our goal here is to try and get to full throttle but have the car all the way to the right before we turn in for the left hand kink before turn 3.

### Turn 3

Our aim here is to turn in for the left hand kink that is turn 2 and be full throttle until the start of the grey curb, that is where we lift and start to brake lightly in a diagonal line towards the outside of the track. Once we get to the outside of the track we are turning in for turn 3 – it is one long brake zone. We want to apex and hit the apex curb, this is also where we want to pick up the throttle. Use all the road on exit. This should be a 3rd gear corner.

### Turn 4

There is no good brake marker here, you need to rely on depth perception. Our aim here is to get our left side tires on the apex curb, pick up the throttle here and have enough speed to end up about mid road on exit. We don’t want to be anymore to the right than mid road! Should be 2nd or 3rd gear.

### Turn 5 + 6

We want to apex turn 5 and try to get back to full throttle just after apex. Use all of the road in between 5 and 6. We then need to lift to get weight back on the front to make it down to the second apex. The road is cambered so we need that early-ish turn in, we want to get our right side tires all over the curbs. We are also looking to get back to full throttle as early as possible. Should be 3rd or 4th gear here.

### Esses

Our turn in point is the end of the access road on the right. In some cars this whole section is flat out, not all, but work up to it.   We want to get all the way to the left to get our left side tires as close to the grey the curb as possible without touching it. It is a rhythm section so getting the right turn in is vital. For the next part of the esses we want our hands straight as we go over the bump in the road right there at the curb. So we need to turn in at the right moment to allow us to do that. Use all of the apex curb. We then want to turn back to the left to get close to the grey curb and back to the right at the top of the esses getting close to the grey curb. As we come out of the esses we want to end up about mid road before setting up for turn 10.

### Turn 10

We want our car all the way to the right before turning in for turn 10. There is no good braking marker here, I usually get my hands straight and start braking then. Our aim is to apex right at the start of the apex curb, and that is where we want to start getting to throttle. Anticipating the downhill and cresting the hill will push the car wider than we are, so need to be heads up about that. We want to use all the road on exit, but then hustle the car quickly back to the left.

### Oak Tree

Our braking marker here should be right around the 3 marker or so depending on your car. We need to get the car all the way to the left before braking. Our objective here is to have one long brake zone, braking all the way to the second apex of oak tree. So we have hard initial brake, but then lightening up as we get to the first apex. We want enough speed at this point to carry the car all the way out using all the road in the middle of the corner, you need to lighten up the brakes to do this. As we get to the middle of the corner using all the road we want to then turn back in for the second apex. Starting our acceleration as we get to the apex curb. At the second apex getting to initial throttle and full throttle is vital. You can use the apex curb or avoid it, up to your preference. Use all the road on exit!

### Turn 14

Our eventual braking marker here should be around the 1 board or slightly deeper depending on the car. After braking we want to almost immediately turn left up the hill and apexing the start of the grey curb on the left. As we crest the hill we don’t want to be any farther right than mid road before turning it right into 14. We want to apex the start of the colour curb, getting our wheel on the grey curbing. On exit we don’t want to be any further than mid road to setup for the next left kink.

### Turn 15

We want to be about mid road or slightly more to the right before turning into turn 15. Here it should just be a slight life and 3rd gear depending on the car you are in. Our main goal here is entry speed so try to hold throttle as long as possible into corner.

### Turn 16

Our turn in marker for turn 16 is just past the end of our curb on the right. It is blind going in so we want to aim to have our left side tire all over the apex curb and our hands as straight as possible over the crest of the hill. If done right we should end up mid road or slightly more to the left of that as we crest of the hill. Our goal then is to turn right away into the first apex to the right. Ideally we our committing to throttle before the compression, and getting to full throttle in the compression, getting a good exit here is vital. Avoid that first right hander apex curb, and this whole section should be in 3rd gear. The final corner is flat out depending on your car, but we absolutely need to apex it, and use all the road on exit.
