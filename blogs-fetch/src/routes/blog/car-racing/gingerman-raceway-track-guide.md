## GingerMan Raceway Rac Track Notes

### Turn 1

The road crests near the end of our braking zone, so we need to get most of our braking done before the crest in the road so that when we get there we can get very light on the brakes. It is easy to lock up tires or get heavy into ABS over that crest, which causes us to miss our apex point.

A good turn in marker is right around the last white pole or the start of the concrete curbing on our right hand side. We want to apex right around the middle of the apex curb and that is also where our initial throtltle applciation should come in as well. Use all the road on exit!

### Turn 2

We need to hustle the car back to the left pretty quickly after the exit of one. Into turn 2 we need to focus on a slow initial turn in so we can really flow that entry speed into the corner and not apex too early. Turning in about 2/3rds of the way towards the left side of the track.

Our apex is the start of the apex curb that comes pretty far around the corner. That is also where our initial throttle application should come. Get out to the exit curb near the start of that exit curb.

### Turn 3

Here the initial braking zone the road is quite flat, but right near the turn in the road drops downhill. This means we need a little bit earlier of a braking zone and to get a lot of our braking done early. We want to turn in right before the road starts to drop down hill.

Another very late apex here, so a very slow and progressive turn in is needed here. Our apex is very close to the end of the apex curb, where it sticks out farthers as the road starts to go up hill. Use all the road on exit!

### Turn 4

Fast corner so important to have a smooth turn in. Apex just passed the start of the apex curb and use all the road on exit.

### Turn 5

Another light brake zone where we are focused on rolling entry speed. Our turn in marker is again right about the 1 board as well. We want to apex the first third of the apex curb and use all the road on exit as we have enough time to get back to the left before we are braking for turn 6.

### Turns 5 and 6

Turn 5 is a total entry speed corner. In this section once we start braking for turn 5 we don't want to pick the throttle back up until the apex of turn 6. We want to apex the end of the apex curb for turn 5 and get our eyes focused on the turn 6 apex right around here. While we are finding that turn 6 apex with our eyes, make sure you are letting the car drift off to the right and using all the road on exit of turn 5 so we can open our radius up for turn 6.

Turning in for turn 6 before the end of the exit curb on our right. Apexing the middle of the apex curb and only picking up our initial throttle here. Use all the road on exit!

### Turn 7

Decently light brake zone here and focused on rolling a good amount of entry speed. We have a decently late apex here, about 1 - 2 car lengths before the end of the apex curb. Let the car be free immediately after the apex.

### Turn 8 and 9

Some cars can be flat through 8 and some will need a full lift. If you do need to lift try and time it to come at the turn in point into turn 8 so we can get the nose pointed down towards the apex. Apex comes about a car length before the start of the apex curb and we want to hold this apex until the end of the curb before we start to work our way into turn 9.

Turn 9 apex comes just before the start of the apex curb here as well - really important to have your eyes up looking far forward here! Use all of the track at exit.

### Turn 10

A very long duration corner that drops downhill on entry. Important to have a light but long trail brake so you can get the front grip you need here. We only want our apex and initial throttle to come right around the middle of the corner. Get the eyes up looking for that exit curb so we can get back to full throttle and open our hands as early as possible. Get out to the exit curb as it is starting.

### Turns 11

Another downhill braking zone here. Turn in point comes right around the last white pole marker on our left hand side. We want to get our right front very close the apex curb. Our apex comes just passed where the apex curb widens up and that is also where our initial throttle application comes in.
