### Video Transcript

Hey everyone, welcome to Blayze, I'm really excited about today's lesson. We're going to be breaking down one of the coolest corners in all of Motorsports, the corkscrew at Laguna Seca. It features an eight story drop after the first apex that's completely blind for the driver. It could be one of the most difficult corners for a driver to find their rhythm on, so we're going to give you all of the important keys and factors for this corner to find your rhythm and be fast around it. So let's get right into it.

So we're on board here at Laguna Seca, we're getting ready to get up to the corkscrew. Go a little bit farther forward and we'll start breaking apart the break zone. The first important part as drivers that we need to know is we're going to be breaking parallel to this curb here on the left hand side. We'll really be breaking just about the end of the curb, before we start to turn back to the right to get ready, to turn in for the corkscrew.

As we go just a little bit farther forward here, go frame by frame, you can see that we're parallel with the curb, going under the banner, going under the banner, parallel, parallel, parallel, right at the end of the curb, so just back it up a little bit right here. This is going to be where we initially have our turning spot back the right hand side of the road. So we go frame by frame again, see right here we're starting to turn in, back to the right side of the road.

The next really important part of this is as we come over the crest of the hill our goal is to keep it right and keep it parallel with this outside curb and if you can even get your right side tire on this curb, that would be great. So we really focus on sacrificing maybe just a little bit of speed, maybe not breaking quite as deep as we can to be able to keep it to the right side of the road to open the radius up as we turn in for the corkscrew and that will really help us flow more speed and get the throttle earlier.

So you can see here, we're parallel to that right side of the road here. We spot like this, right side tire's just on this curb and we really already have our eyes looking into the apex. We can't quite really see it great yet, but your eyes are trying to pick it up. So what we're going to do now is parallel, parallel, parallel, we're getting ready to turn in. We're going to have a pretty late turn in and we definitely need to get down to the apex curb by the tires at the apex.

See we're still parallel, let's go a little bit farther forward. Right there at the one board we're starting to turn in. You're looking down to the apex and what we want to do, we have a slightly later apex here. We want to apex where the curb is at it's thickest point. We don't want to apex before these tires here, before the blue and white stripes. We want to apex where it's at its thickest point. So what we are going to do here is go a little bit farther forward, getting ready so you could see here pretty late apex. Now you can see we're going to be right here is where in between these two red lines where we want our left side tire on this curb. Now you almost want it in the dirt, you want to use as much of this curb as possible, so that you can open the radius and set up for the right hander down the hill.

Now it's the eight story drop coming up here, so it's obviously completely blind for drivers, you don't know where you're going to end up. So what we want to do is see right here, use all that curb, go a little bit farther forward. So we're going to hold it just a little bit left past this first apex here, so when we go over the hill, we're in the right spot. If you open your hands too early, you're going to end up to the inside of the apex curb at the bottom of the hill which we often see, which is really rough to the bottom of your car, you obviously want to avoid that.

So to help avoid that, keep turning left, just a little bit past that curb so here we're getting ready to set up. It's still completely blind for drivers so you can't see where you're going to end up. Some drivers like to look for the trees here, to know where to keep your hands straight. I never like to do that, I'm more, drive more off a feel here, keeping that left hand turn, so that when we crest, which is right here, your hands are straight. Just for the moment you crest and then once you can see the curb, you could turn down to it, so focus on keeping left a little bit past the curb, up the first apex. Hands are straight as we crest over the hill. We can now start to see it, we're starting to apply major throttle.

We want to have our eyes down here but we want our right side tire just a nicky-nack curb on the apex, but then use all of the road on exit here. You don't want to get all the way back to the road, all the way back to the right side of the road to set up a turn now, you actually end up turning down the inside. So apexing here, getting back to as much throttle as we can, using all the road on exit. And that's how we tackle the corkscrew.

So that was our Blayze coaching tips on how to tackle the corkscrew at Laguna Seca. What an awesome corner, dropping eight stories at over 100 miles an hour, there's nothing else like it, so if you've any other questions on how to master the corkscrew, leave a comment below. We'll make sure to answer that and if you want us to break down your favorite corner, leave a comment on what your favorite corner is and what you want to see and we'll make sure that we go into it in a future Blayze video.
