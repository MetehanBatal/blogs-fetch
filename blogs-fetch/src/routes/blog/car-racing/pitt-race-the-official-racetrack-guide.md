### PittRace Official Race Track Notes

### Turn 1

The braking zone is uphill here. For most cars we will work towards having a braking zone near or inside of the 3 board. We are really focused on trying to maximize our exit out of turn 1. Our turn should come right after the road crests and starts to fall downhill. We want to apex about 1 car length passed the start of the apex curb and that is where we should pick up initial throttle application. Use all the road on corner exit.

### Turn 2

This is a very fast and blind corner where the car gets really light as we create the hill. What is important here is to have our hands as straight as possible as we crest the hill. The turn in should come about 1 car length passed the end of the access road on our right hand side. We want a nice and slow, smooth turn in here. Some series are okay with crossing over the pit exit lane and some are not, if you are going to do that make sure you know no one is there. Either way we want to get as close to it as possible and have our left front tire still on it as it ends. Its okay to start off the weekend conservative here and as you get more comortable you will start to open your hands earlier and use all the road on exit.

### Turns 3 and 4

We want to maximize our entry speed into 3 and our exit out of 4 here. Most drivers will want to work their braking zone inside or around the 3 board. Another uphill braking zone, so attack the brakes hard here. Our turn in will come as the road crests. We want to bring in a lot of entry speed and trail brake passed the turn 3 apex, which comes in the middle of the apex curb. We want to let the car run to about mid track on exit, quick squirt of throttle if you need, but an early light touch of the brakes and an early-ish turn in for turn 4. The important thing in turn 4 is picking up the throttle only at the apex, getting back to full throttle soon after that and use all the road at corner exit.

### Turn 5

We want to bring the car back a little bit to the right before the left kink into turn 5. We are trying to get parallel to the left side of the road after that kink while braking. The key in turn 5 is to roll in entry speed and have a very slow, progressive turn in so we don't apex too early. We only want to apex after the middle of the apex curb and get our car parallel to the backend of the apex curb. That will allow us to unwind the steering wheel earlier and pick up full throttle earlier.

### Turns 7 - 11

The important part of this section is having a plan. When drivers don't have a plan they end up semi-sacrificng every corner and spending a lot of time at maitenance throttle. The easy thing to think about here is to attack our right handers and sacrifice the left handers here.

So, in turn 7 let's bring in a lot of entry speed and use all the road on corner exit. We want to apex just passed the start of it and let the car be free on corner exit. Into turn 8 we will need to sacrifice a bit here. Out of turn 8 we want to only use about half the road and get back to the left to setup for turn 9. At all times here we are trying to avoid maintenance throttle, so think about spending less time on throttle overall but more time at full throttle.

We want to maximize our run through turn 9 and apex just passed the start of the apex curb. Using about half the track on corner exit. We then want to sacrifice turn 10 to setup to the left for turn 11. Once we pick up the throttle out of turn 10 we want to try and keep it full throttle until we are braking into turn 12.

### Turns 12 and 13

Almost as soon as we get our hands straight out of 11 we are braking for turn 12. We want a long trail brake here to keep the car slightly to the right to setup for turn 13. We are starting our turn in as the road starts to go uphill and apexing the middle of the curb. Ideally we are trail braking all the way down to the apex curb. We only want to use about half the road on exit to try and be full throttle or as close to that through turn 13.

### Turn 14

Turn 14 is blind on entry. So, out of 13 we need to keep our call all the way to the left and our turn in for 14 starts right as the road starts to fall downhill. We want a smooth and slow turn in here. If it is your first time here you will want to air on the side of a slightly late apex, rather than a super early one but we want to apex just before the middle of the apex curb. Use all the road on exit as you have plenty of time to hustle the car back to the right to setup for turn 15.

### Turn 15

For turn 15 focus on smooth and slow hands. We want to apex the start of the apex curb and let the car be free on corner exit.

### Turn 16

For turn 16 we want our speed manipulation done early as it is a fast corner where we don't want any abrupt speed or steering changes after turn in. It is totally okay to coast in this corner. We want to try and pick up initial throttle at the start of the apex curb, entry speed is the most important thing here. Try and get a quick squirt of full throttle before the brake zone into turn 17.

### Turn 17

The most important thing in turn 17 is the exit as we will be flat all the way into turn 1. We want our turn in to come as the road starts going uphill more steeply and apex 2/3rds of the way around the apex curb. The critical thing here is to not apex too early or pick up initial throttle too early. We want our throttle to only come as we start unwinding the steering wheel at corner exit. Get those eyes up and use all the road on exit and then get the car back to the right to setup for turn 19.

### Turn 19

This corner should be flat for nearly everyone. Focus on a very smooth and slow turn in here. Turn in comes just as the grass starts to separate the track and pit road entry. Apex the start of the apex curb and let the car be free and use all the road at corner exit.
