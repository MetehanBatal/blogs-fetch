## Heartland Motorsports Park Race Track Notes

### Turn 1 and 2

As we crest the hill coming into the braking zone for turn 1 we want to be pretty close the apex curb on the inside and brake towards the outside of the track.

Turn 1 itself is more of an entry speed corner and the important thing here is to be back to full throttle as early as possible out of or thru turn 2. That means we need to sacrifice a little bit of speed through turn 1 and keep it mostly to the right on the exit of turn 1. Ideally we only pick up initial throttle mid curb in turn 1 and if turn 2 is not flat get back to full throttle at the apex of turn 2 and use all the road on corner exit.

### Turn 3

For turn 3 we want to treat this like a double apex and really attack the corner entry. This will help us bring in more entry speed, delay our initial throttle application so that we spend less time on maintenance throttle and get back to full throttle as early as possible.

We want to brake towards the inside of the corner and bring in enough entry speed to have the car push about 1 car width wide of the inside of the corner in the middle of it. As the car starts to rotate we want to come back and apex the start of the apex curb. We are working back to throttle as we approach that apex curb and want to be back to full throttle as it starts. Use all the road on exit, but hustle back to the left before turn in for turn 4.

### Turn 4

We want to get back to the left as much as possible. What is key here is to get our head turned and eyes focused to the apex of turn 4 as early as possible. It is a light brake zone and you can bring in a good amount of entry speed.

We want to delay our initial throttle application to come only at the apex point and start to open our hands to get out to that exit curb as early as possible.

### Turn 5

In turn 5 we want a long trail brake to bring in the entry speed and get enough rotation to get back to full throttle as early as possible. Our turn in comes about 1 car length before the end of the curb on our left and we want to apex right around the middle of the apex curb, focusing on trail braking all the way down to the apex.

We want to work to get back to full throttle before we get out to the exit curb and get out to that exit curb as early as possible.

### Turn 6

Turn 6 is another corner where trail braking is key. We want to trail brake all the way down to the apex, which is the middle of the apex curb. That will allow us to pick up throttle there and get back to full throttle soon after that.

### Turn 7

This a fast uphill corner without any good reference points for the turn in marker. Some cars will be flat through here and others may need a small lift. The key is a smooth and slow turn in before the curb on the right hand side starts. We want to apex about mid curb and use all the road on corner exit. Get those eyes up!

### Turn 8 and 9

The key here is to try and get back to full throttle as early as possible out of turn 8 and keep full throttle through turn 9. Turn 9 is pretty easy flat, so we don't need to sacrifice speed at the exit of turn 8 to setup for turn 9.

In the chicane of turn 8 we want to trail brake passed the first apex curb. The apex comes about mid apex curb and we want to try and work back to initial throttle just before the second curb which is on the right and back to full throttle soon after that.

### Turn 10

Turn 10 is an entry speed corner and it is important to maximize our speed through here and not sacrifice anything on corner exit. Our braking marker will usually come between the 2 and 3 board. We want to apex about mid apex curb and trail brake all the way down to that point.

Start opening our hands and getting aggressively back to throttle after that while using all the road on exit. Our hands will never really get straight here as we want to hustle it as far back to the left as we can but we will likely only get back to about mid road.

### Turn 11 and 12

We want to trail brake through turn 11 and get a squirt of throttle in-between 11 and 12. The important thing here is getting back to full throttle out of turn 12. We want to apex turn 12 about a car length or two passed the start of the apex curb. We want to work back to aggressive throttle about mid apex curb and use all the road on exit while hustling it back to the left to setup for turn 13.

### Turns 13 and 14

The important thing here is to setup to the right for turn 14 and get back to full throttle as early as possible out of turn 14.

In turn 13 we want to trail brake passed the apex curb to help rotate the car and keep it to the inside with as much speed as possible. We want a short squirt of throttle out of 13 but we want to keep the car all the way to the right as we get ready to turn in for turn 14. In turn 14 we want a light and long trail brake, apex the middle of the curb and make sure you don't pick up the throttle any earlier than that!
