Hey everyone, Coach Dion is here with another coaching race tip in under 60 seconds! We are going to cover how to improve your heel and toe braking techniques.

## Use the Knee Pivot

The first thing I want you to focus on is what I call the knee pivot. As you are driving, getting ready to brake, before the brake zone, I want you to pivot your right knee toward the steering column.

When you are sitting in the driver’s position and pivot your knee inward, your foot naturally gets in the perfect spot for the brake pedal. You want your toe crossed over the brake pedal and not perpendicular to it. This will help keep your foot from slipping off the pedal.

Braking is the most important part of the heel and toe downshift. Make sure your foot stays on the brake pedal!

The second thing I want you to focus on is the [timing of the blip](https://blayze.io/blog/car-racing/when-to-blip). You want to time your blip as you are entering the gate of the gear you are downshifting to. So, if you are going 4th to 3rd, brake, clutch in, then take it out of 4th gear. As you are going into 3rd gear, that’s when the blip quickly happens, then drop the clutch.

This will let you blip with 10 percent throttle. It should be a little bit and that is all you need.

That is our coaching tip in under 60 seconds. Hopefully, this helps improve your heel and toe technique. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to reach out to us at Blayze at any time.
