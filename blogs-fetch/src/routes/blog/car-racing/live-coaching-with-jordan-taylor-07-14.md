As Jordan identifies this is because he overloads the front too quickly.<br/><br/>We are often told that our highest brake pressure needs to come right away in a brake zone, but in more GT style or production style cars we often want to spend just a little bit of time building up to that peak brake pressure. The peak pressure still comes early in the brake zone, but we just hesitate slightly to let the weight transfer happen and once the weight is on the front we attack the brakes.<br/><br/>That will help give Ben a little more consistent car in the brake zone and more confidence at corner entry."}
