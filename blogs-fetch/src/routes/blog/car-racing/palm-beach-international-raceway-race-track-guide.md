excerpt: Palm Beach International Raceway is a fun and technical race track in sunny south Florida.  It makes for a great test track as it has long corner to test g-loads for cars and a very long straight away to reach very high top speeds.  Make sure those brakes are working though as you have a very important and big brake zone at the end of the back straight.

### Important Notes For What To Look For

The goal of showing these lines are to help you understand where you should place your vehicle and give you a good idea of where we want to work back to throttle (the foundation of how we learn a track).  Don't focus on trying to find the perfect brake zone on this map, this is very generalized as it is meant for lots of different car types.


Some of our brake zones may be too late or too early for you - so focus heavily on how the lines transition.  See which braking zones we have a deep trail brake and which ones don't.  See where we are picking the throttle back up, that is the most important part!
