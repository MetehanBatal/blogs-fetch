## MSR Cresson Race Track Notes

### Rattlesnake

o Brake on the left side of the track angled toward the end of the tire wall. Try to get a late straight braking done to get your minimum speed as late as possible before turn in to the first apex.

o Full throttle between 1st and 2nd chicane.

o Follow the 3rd curb until it is a straight line to the 4th apex. This will set the car up to track out before turning in to the next corner.

### Wagon Wheel

o Make sure to have tracked out track right from Rattle Snake. Make sure to have carried enough speed into the corner so that you can have as little throttle input as possible. Very important to get a late apex about a car length before the end of the apex curbing. As soon as you reach the apex start to slowly unwind the wheel and applying throttle to get a good run down the straight away into Ricochet.

### Ricochet

o This corner is all about carrying speed and momentum. Low horsepower cars like Miatas can take this corner flat. Most cars will have a lift or brush of the brakes just before turn in. Make sure to get the lift or brush of the brakes done BEFORE turning in. Use all of the track out on exit to make sure you can keep the speed up and not pinch the car causing it to spin left.

### Little Bend

o Setup on left side of the track. Angle braking towards last cone or the empty lot ahead. Turn in and place the car over the end of the dark black patch or seal and make sure to have a slightly later apex. On exit you should run over another dark black patch of sealer to use as a good reference of where you are tracking out.

### Buzzard Neck

o Brake short and hard at the first cone and use the 2nd cone as a turn in reference. There is a bump at apex, so make sure to get back to throttle right after the bump. Carry as much speed as possible through the apex and use all the track out on the exit. This leads into a very short straight and 2nd slowest corner on the track.

### Horseshoe

o Enter this corner from mid track. Just a tap of the brakes to get the car to turn in should be enough. Follow the apex curbing until the biggest power pole in the background lines up with the apex curbing. Be cautious with wheel spin or the car sliding as you crest the hill. Try carrying more speed in the corner so you donâ€™t have to be full throttle before the crest.

### Boot Hill

o Try to maintain a steady steering angle through this corner. Add as much throttle as possible without having too wide of a radius and sliding off track.

### Tombstone

o You should still have a consistent steering angle from Boot Hill and be modulating the car to correct the cars balance and radius through the corner. Work on getting a slightly late apex here and full throttle as soon as possible leading onto the straight.

### Big Bend

o Brake later than you think and carry more speed into the entry that you at first believe you can. Being early down to the apex curbing is ok. There is plenty of grip and allows you to be smooth with the steering input and smooth to be back onto the throttle. Use the control tower in the paddock as a good reference for your track out. You can get on the gas quickly and aggressively because of the entry speed and grip, but make sure to not run out of room on the exit as it continues to tighten and turn left.
