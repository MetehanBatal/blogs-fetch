## Talladega Grand Prix Race Track Notes



### 1) Use The Turn 2 Banking

Turn 1 is the fastest on the track with good banking and provides for a big run down to T2 for a heavy brake zone. The banking of T2 will catch the car at the apex to help rotate.



### 2) Patience & Late Apex Turns 4 and 5

Turn 4/5 is painfully long, but be patient and emphasize the late apex. The "school line" demonstrated in the video is to start outside and just wait until you see T5. The more advanced approach would be to aim the car towards the center of the corner and trail brake into the corner.



### 3) Focus On Turn 6 Exit

Turn 6 is important as it leads onto a long straight. Make sure to compress your braking for T8, but don't hurt your exit onto the front straight.
