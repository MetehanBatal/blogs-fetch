### How to use onboard videos to study for a race track

Onboard videos are the best way to study for upcoming events at a specific track. To take advantage of studying ahead of time put less emphasis on finding exact braking zones in these videos, focus more on the overall line, initial throttle application spot, and where the driver attacks a specific corner or sacrifices a specific corner on the race track!
