## Rockingham Speedway Road Course Race Track Notes



### 1) Be Prepared To Not Be Flat In The Banking

This is a very short lap with a steeply banked oval section. Tighter than the Charlotte roval, this corner is a bit tougher for faster cars. Spec Miata or SpecE30 type cars can typically go full throttle, but faster cars may have to adjust speed on entry.



### 2)  Tighter Than You Think Entering The Infield

The corner entering the infield looks much tighter than it actually is because you can't see past the wall. The apex, and therefore slowest point of the corner is quite a ways past the wall, so try to compress the brake zone in order to increase the time spent at vMax.



### 3) Focus On Entry Speed And A Long Trail Brake In Turn 2

Trail brake into the second corner to "diamond" the radius and carry more entry speed.



#### 4) All About Entry Speed In The Infield Kink

Carry as much speed as you can through the infield kink without sacrificing exit speed from the final corner. Don't be afraid of the wall at the last apex!
