## Autobahn Country Club Full Course Race Track Notes

### Turn 1

Most cars will be braking somewhere in between the 3 and 4 boards that are found on the grass to the right side of the track. We want to focus on getting off of heavy brake pressure pretty early so we can roll in a good amount of entry speed and extend our braking zone. This will allow us to get that rotation we need in the middle of the corner to get down to our second apex and not pick up the throttle too early.

Only pick up initial throttle as you are heading towards that second apex, which is the start of that second apex curb.

### Turn 2

We want to focus on a late apex here so we can get back to full throttle out of turn 2 and try to keep that through turn 3. If you are running out of road on exit and able to commit back to full throttle then you have likely turned in too early or picked up your initial throttle too early.

Our turn in point is usually the very end of the pit lane exit on our left hand side. Apexing the middle to back end of the apex curb.

### Turn 3

We want to setup to the right hand side here before turning into turn 3. It is really important to get our eyes looking to the left as early as possible. Apexing right at the middle of the curb for turn 3 and that is where we want to pick up our initial throttle aggressively.

### Turn 4

A very light brake zone here, focus on rolling entry speed. Typically we want our turn in to come around the 1 board. We want to apex about 1 car length passed the start of the apex curb, we need to pick up our eyes early to see that exit curb and get out to it early and use all the track on exit.

### Turn 5

Another light brake zone where we are focused on rolling entry speed. Our turn in marker is again right about the 1 board as well. We want to apex the first third of the apex curb and use all the road on exit as we have enough time to get back to the left before we are braking for turn 6.

### Turn 6

Turn 6 has a very awkward braking zone. We want to angle our car so that when we hit the brakes initially we are angled towards the outside of the track to the turn in for the corner. Being able to trail brake effectively here is key. As we start to turn in for our apex we want to be very light on the brakes to help bring the car down to the apex.

Only picking up initial throttle as the road compresses at the apex. Our apex should come right about mid curb.

### Turn 7

Keep those eyes up and apex the start of the apex curb.

### Turn 8

Most drivers will work towards getting just inside the 4 board before braking (can change a lot depending on your car so be careful). Another corner where we want a nice long trail brake and it is important not to apex too early. We want to apex mid curb and be really focused on getting back to full throttle as early as possible.

### Turns 9 and 10

Short squirt of full throttle between 8 and 9. Into 9 we want a light and long brake zone so that we can trail brake passed the apex point. That additional weight on the front nose will allow us to get more rotation and keep it to the right at a higher speed. The most important thing here is to get back to full throttle as early as possible out of turn 10.

We want to get a short squirt of full throttle in between 9 and 10 and as we turn back for turn 10 that is where we time our lift or if you need a small application of the brakes it should come then. Importantly we need to make sure we are delaying our initial throttle until we can start to unwind the steering wheel out of turn 10. Apexing the start of the apex curb so we can use the camber in the road to our advantage. Make sure we use all the road on exit.

### Turns 11 and 12

In this section we are focused on trying to get back to full throttle as early as possible while keeping full throttle through turn 12. Working slowly towards braking inside the 5 for most cars is a good point. For turn 11 we have another corner with a very long trail brake to hold it to the right.

Turn 11 we want to slowly roll more and more entry speed until turn 12 is no longer flat, that is where we know we are over the limit and back it down slightly from there.

### Turn 13

This a downhill braking zone, so expect to have slightly less grip in this braking zone. Turning in right around the 1 board and apexing just passed the start of the apex curb. Use about half of the road at corner exit so you don't over sacrifice for turn 14 as we have sometime to continue turning right and get it back most of the way to the right before turn in for 14 comes.

### Turn 14

Might just be a lift or a very light brake for most cars. We want to roll in that entry speed, apex the start of the apex curb and use all of the road on exit.

### Turn 15

All about being smooth into turn 15 to allow the weight transfer to move slowly to bring in that entry speed. Work it back to the left before turn in, but we do not need to get all the way out to the left. Apex should come just around the start of the apex curb and that is where we should be working it back to full throttle.

### Turn 16

A good braking zone to work towards is getting inside the 4 marker on our left hand side. This a very late apex, so really slow hands on turn in is critical and a deep, long trail brake is important as well. We want to apex the middle of the apex curb so we can start to unwind the steering wheel before we get out to the exit curb.

### Turns 17 - 19

Into turn 17 we are braking right around the 3 board. We are looking to start of the apex curb, which comes pretty far around the corner. Hustle the car back to the left to setup for turn 18.

Apexing the end of the apex curb, but important to get down to it to use the camber in the road. Our initial squirt of throttle should come right here in 18. Use all the road on exit of 18. Trying to be full throttle as early as possible out of 18/19 to get the run onto the front straight.
