## What's the fastest way around a race track?

I LOVE asking this question when I'm at a race track.  I've probably asked this to 500+ racecar drivers and I've yet to hear the correct response.  The typical responses I hear are:

The shortest distance
The line that trail brakes longer
The "racing" line that has earlier apexes

Did you see the subject of this email and think one of these?  Don't worry that's totally normal, because that's what you have been taught.

If you didn't I'd love for you to reply with what you thought the answer way!

Okay... are you ready for the answer?

The fastest line around the race track is the one that lets you spend the most amount of time around the lap at full throttle.  It's really that simple!  

Of course, simple to understand... much harder to do in practice.  Next time you're on track I want you VERY focused on getting back and holding full throttle.

Notice that moment you can't get back to full throttle because you aren't opening your hands?  But... you have an extra car width of race track you aren't using at corner exit?  Open those hands and get back to full throttle!

This is a great snippet from a Blayze+ Live coaching session.  Here Blayze pro coach, [Colin Mullan](https://blayze.io/coach/colin-mullan), uses data and video to show you how he finds grip during his first laps on track on a wet race track.

## A GREAT Example Of Defending Position

Recently I've spoken a lot about how to defend position correctly.  The most important thing to know is that when making a defensive move we need to do it PROACTIVELY and before the brake zone.

I've been honestly surprised by the most common response I hear from drivers... the most common response has been, "Am I just supposed to let the car behind me pass whenever they want then??  That's not racing."

I've never understood the response.  No one is saying you can't defend ðŸ¤”.

Here is the perfect example of a great defensive move by Jack Hawksworth.   Go to the 25 second mark and you will see his proactive defensive move into 10a at Road Atlanta.  Now... I won't comment on everything that happens after that ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
