## Why am I always faster when I have someone in front of me to chase?

Do you notice that you're always faster when you have someone in front of you to chase down?  Why can't I keep that speed up while I'm by myself?

If this sounds like you, guess what?  You're normal.  And you know what the best news is?  It's fixable!

The reason why you're often slower when you're by yourself is that you don't have a proper feedback loop while driving.  What makes racing so damn hard is that there is SO much noise while out on the track.  When I say noise, I don't mean the literal noise of your engine and tires, I mean there is so much to pay attention to that it can overwhelm us.

Elite level drivers and riders know what the important factors are and relentlessly focus on those.  What are those factors for me?

- Brake pressure
- Apex point
- Initial throttle application point
- Where I get back to full throttle
- Feeling in the steering wheel (aka when it goes light as understeer comes in)
- Feeling in my body of what the car is doing


By limiting the things I'm focusing on I'm able to hone in on the things that actually matter.  Regardless of if there is a car in-front of me or if I'm by myself the focus stays the same.  I'm focused on these points in **every single corner**.

Here is an example of how this works:

I'm very focused on increasing entry speed until I feel the steering wheel start to become light.  Usually as the steering starts to get light that is the beginning of understeer.  

If I turn a little bit more and the car responds and turns more, I know I'm not at the limit.  In this moment I'm extremely focused on this one thing.  I'm also ensuring that I'm not anticipating the understeer or oversteer, I'm driving until the car starts to prevent me from going any faster.

Building in the right feedback loops on track is vital to quieting the noise and focusing on the right things.  It's one of the major things our coaches at Blayze help drivers learn.

## Video of the week:  Just a little opposite lock at 320mph ðŸ¤¯

I have a confession to make.  When I watch Indy 500 qualifying I'm pretty sure I hold my breathe during every drivers 2 minute run.

The commitment it takes to drive at the absolute limit for four laps, at 240mph, as the tires degrade is mind boggling.  But, thankfully there are 33 drivers out there that feeling differently!
