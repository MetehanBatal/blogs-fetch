<h3>How do you determine the proper braking point for turn one on the start of the race?</h3>

This is a pretty challenging thing to do and to be honest it's really about learning through experience.  But, there are ways to learn faster and as with many things in racing it's often about knowing where to focus and what to take into consideration.  

So, below are the things I'm considering when trying to find my turn 1 brake zone at the race start:

1. Where are on the straight is the acceleration zone?  
2. What's the ambient / track temperature?
3. How quickly do my tires usually come up to temp?
4. How many pace laps did I have?
5. Is turn 1 a big brake zone type corner or more of a sweeper/high speed corner?
6. How long is the race and how much risk should I be taking? 


Notice on the first part I'm not really asking myself where the green flag is, it's much more important to know where your acceleration zone is as that determines your speed into turn 1.  This also changes a bit depending on where you are on the grid.

For example, at the Sebring 12 Hour if you're near the front you are typically accelerating from around the start of the pit entry wall.  If you're farther back your usually flat from around the middle of turn 17.

Both of these acceleration zones are relatively early compared to many race tracks so when you arrive into turn 1 at the race start you're coming in with close to your normal speed but obviously not exactly the same.

It's also important to know that Sebring is usually hot as hell and it's a very long race track so I have plenty of time to get my tires up to a good working temp.  So, I'm usually expecting to have a pretty decent amount of grip into turn 1 at Sebring.

That means I'm actually thinking about braking a little deeper than my normal brake zone.  The key word being "a little".  I would be thinking of braking one or two car lengths deeper than normal into turn 1.

As you'll see there is no golden rule of brake in X spot into turn 1 at the race start (spoiler alert: golden rules don't really exist in racing!) but if you can limit the noise and know what exactly to consider when barreling into turn 1 you will typically be able to find the right level of aggression in your brake zone.

Excuse me while a pick my jaw up off the floor.... 

1,000hp, 2,000 pounds of downforce, a fan in the back of the car that literally creates downforce, and it goes 0-60 in under 1.4 seconds ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯

Any stat you hear about this car is just absolutely ridiculous and I freaking love it.
