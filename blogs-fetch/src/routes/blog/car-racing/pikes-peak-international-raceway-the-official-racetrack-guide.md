## Pikes Peak International Raceway Track Notes



#### 1) Stick To The Painted Marks In The Banking

The banking can be intimidating, but stick to the painted marks that indicate the line and slowly build speed lap by lap. Make sure your eyes are way ahead so that you can make small changes if you start to get offline before it becomes a big problem.



#### 2) Focus On Late Braking Off The Oval

Compress your braking off the oval as it is the highest speed section of track  - - we want to maintain that speed as long as possible.



#### 3) Focus On High Minimum Speed In Every Corner In The Infield Except The Final One

Most of the infield is about maintaining speed as much as possible until you get to the final corner, where you want to shift your focus back to exit speed.
