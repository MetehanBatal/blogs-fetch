## Question of the week: How do I get better at feeling that last bit of brake release?

Dion: Here are 3 things you can do to work towards improving your feel at the end of a brake zone:

- **Have a heel stopper**:  When braking we want to make sure our heel is not in the air. Having a simple heel stopper to rest your heel against below the brake pedal can big a massive help to feeling more attached to the car.
- **Practice on the streets**: No... we don't mean go racing on the streets.  But, think about what you do at a stop sign.  You slowly ease into the brakes and reach maximum pressure as we stop right?  Well, that's the opposite of what we want at the track.  Instead, try building to peak brake pressure early in that brake zone for your stop sign and actually slowly release off the brake pedal as you come to a stop at the stop sign.
- **Ensure you have the right shoes**:  Seems obvious right?  But, it can be often overlooked.  If you are driving in your most comfortable Nike's you may look fast out of the car but you won't be fast in it.  Make sure you have a good pair of proper racing shoes, they have a thin sole that can really help you with feeling the pedals.   Do you have a question you want answered?
