## Virginia International Raceway Patriots Course Race Track Notes



#### 1) Late Apexes: 

Prioritize late apexes on the chicanes so that you are always getting back to power early.



#### 2) Quick Hands

Being such a small course, quick hands are necessary for tight transitions.



#### 3) Use The Elevation

There are significant elevation changes despite how short the lap is, so be sure to utilize the uphill/cambered areas of increased grip to your advantage.
