### How to use onboard videos to study for a race track

Onboard videos are the best way to study for upcoming events at a specific track. To take advantage of studying ahead of time put less emphasis on finding exact braking zones in these videos, focus more on the overall line, initial throttle application spot, and where the driver attacks a specific corner or sacrifices a specific corner on the race track!

Kenton Koch shows everyone here how a fast lap is done around Autobahn Country Club in a light weight Skip Barber racecar!  This will be a great guide for most cars.

We hop onboard with Scott Hargrove as he shows us how its done in a Skip Barber racecar.  Here you can see not only great racing lines but also good areas to overtake.

### Have A Video You Would Like To Submit?

At Blayze we are always looking for videos we can use to help others learn a track and improve. If you feel like you have a lap that is well executed at any race track that others could benefit from please email it to us at team@blayze.io and if our coaches like what they see we will add it to our approved onboard videos!
