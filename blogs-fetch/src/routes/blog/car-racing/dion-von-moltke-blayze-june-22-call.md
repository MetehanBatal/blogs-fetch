In this month's call Dion touched on the following topics:

<li>How do we keep consistent brake pressure while heel toe downshifting?</li>
<li>A deep dive through a very tough section at the NYST race track. Learn how Dion thinks about rolling speed into downhill and off camber corners - this learning will apply to many other tracks!</li>
