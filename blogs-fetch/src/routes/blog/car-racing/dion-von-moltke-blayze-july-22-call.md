In this month's call Dion touched on the following topics:

<li>How do you do the over under overtake</li>
<li>When do I time my defensive move?</li>
<li>When I'm in a 3 way battle how do I handle trying to overtake and defend at the same time?</li>
<li>It's been 5 months since I've been in the car... How do I get up to speed quickly again?</li>
