## Blayze pro-coach, Dion von Moltke, discusses confidence with TenTenths Podcast

As racecar drivers we are always searching for the limit of our racecars on the race track. In this process we are all going to make mistakes and those mistakes usually results in a spin or a crash. So, how can we best get over these scary experiences?

In the podcast racecar driver coach, Dion von Moltke talks about getting back on your feet. To start building your confidence back up, we have to start finding that limit again.

The best way to start doing this again is to identify the "low risk" corners on the track. Those corners where if you were to spin, or brake a little late, no big negative consequences will happen. These are the corners that we will want to play with finding the limit again.

As we start to be able to get closer to the limit and keep it there in these corners, your confidence will naturally start to increase. That will mean organically you will start to get closer to the limit in the faster corners and be on the path to faster lap times!
