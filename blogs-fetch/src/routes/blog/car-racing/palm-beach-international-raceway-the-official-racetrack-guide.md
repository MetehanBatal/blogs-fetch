We need to be hyperfocused on our exit reference points. Working on opening our hands as early as possible so we can maximize when we get back to full throttle.<br /><br /><strong>2) Slow hands and entry speed</strong><br>Its very easy to fall into the trap of late and aggressive turn ins for these long duration corners. But, that aggressive turn in limits our entry speed. Focus on turning in slightly earlier but slower, letting the car run wide mid corner from lots of entry speed, and delaying throttle until the car rotates for the second apex."}
