Sports Car Club of America is happy to announce that it has partnered with Blayze (previously Racers360) as a driver coaching partner for the 2022 season. Hélio Castroneves is excited, too!

Through this partnership, SCCA’s Track Night and Time Trials drivers will gain access to video walk through guides from the professional driver coaches at Blayze for every single track the events visit. SCCA Members will also be able to access 1-on-1 coaching with Blayze coaches at reduced costs throughout the year to continue to improve their driving. The first 300 [Blayze+](https://blayze.io/blayze-plus) members will get a one-year SCCA annual membership and access a special white-glove service to help them find the best place to drive their cars with the SCCA.

“We’re excited to try something new and different with Blayze this year,” said Kristen Poole, Director of Marketing & Communications. “It’s a program that will bring our current members and drivers a tool to improve their on-track driving, while also introducing Blayze+ members to SCCA’s programs. It’s a win-win.”

After working with more than 1,000 drivers, Blayze has seen clear evidence that one-on-one coaching can not only reduce lap times, but also reduce risk and incidents. 

“We could not be more excited to team up with the SCCA and help their drivers not only find speed, but also become safer drivers,” said Blayze co-founder, Dion von Moltke. 

“When you think about grassroots racing in the U.S. you think about the SCCA. They have set the standards for a half century and more,” noted von Moltke. “For us to be able to bring a link to professional drivers and have professional drivers make an impact in the lives of thousands of enthusiast racers is truly special for all our coaches and the team at Blayze!”



<h3>WHY 1 ON 1 COACHING WITH BLAYZE</h3>

On average, drivers using Blayze have gone 1+ second a lap faster after just one coaching session. How is that possible? Blayze brings the world’s best coaches and gives drivers everywhere 1-on-1 personalized coaching sessions with those pro coaches.

Drivers upload video and data from any camera or data system, from any race track, in any type of car. Blayze coaches —an all-star team that includes IMSA DPi Champion Ricky Taylor, Indianapolis 500 front row starter Spencer Pigot, Rolex at Daytona 24 Hour Winner Dion von Moltke, and many more — view that video. They then record a personalized coaching session where they break down the video using slow motion tools, webcams, and more. The coaching session they record is always available for drivers to watch & re-watch anytime.

By focusing on remote but personalized coaching sessions, Blayze has been able to reduce the upfront cost of learning 1-on-1 with the best coaches in the world by up to 95%. 

“I had never considered coaching before because the price tag was always too high,” says enthusiast racer Mark Petronis. “I didn’t realize the power of pro coaching until Blayze made it affordable. After my first coaching session I went 3 seconds faster in my next session. Blayze is the cheapest way to find serious speed on the racetrack.”
