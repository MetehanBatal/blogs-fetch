### The Tight Core

While it may seem like over simplification to some but for riders and drivers alike focusing on proper seating/riding position is one of the most critical factors to developing feel.




But position ourselves correctly we allow our core to do most of the work and get rid of the death grip with our hands.  



Want to know what the correct seating or riding position is?  Send in your video to one of our Blayze coaches and they can help you make the changes necessary both in your position and on your other on-track skills to find lap time!
