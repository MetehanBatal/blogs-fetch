### Low Hanging Fruit In Your Data Notes

Looking at your data does not need to be time consuming or only for those who are great with technology. Here pro racecar coaches Dion von Moltke and Andrew Rains break down 3 easy things to look for in your data, that will be easy to identify no matter what data system you use in your racecar.

### 1) Speed Trace

##### Rounded tops

One major thing we want to avoid is a slow release of the throttle or long lift periods as we are arriving into a braking zone. You can see this on data by flat tops, or rounded tops on your speed trace as you approach a braking zone.

##### Solution:

We typically see racecar drivers doing this when they are nervous about where they are braking and are trying to go deeper than where they are comfortable. We care more about good fundamentals than a deep brake zone.

So, if this is you back up your initial braking zone and focus on a quick transition off full throttle to a hard brake application. Then as you get comfortable start slowly working your brake zone back up.

### 2) Long G

##### Inconsistent Braking

In the vast majority of corner the perfect braking zone has peak brake pressure come nearly right away followed by a consistent and slow release off the brake pedal.

When you look at your long g channel and zoom in on the braking zones what do you see? Do you see a line that goes up and down in the middle of the brake zone? Then this is an area for us to work on!

##### Solution

There are a lot of reasons why your brake pressure may be inconsistent. The most common area we find this is for drivers in manual cars where they need to heel toe downshift. If you struggle with this then we recommend checking out this in-depth article from Racer360

### 3) Friction Circle

##### Dots To Close To The Middle

On the friction circle we want to look at where the heaviest concentration of our dots are. The closer the center of the friction the more time you are spending not at the limit of the car.

As you work on driving closer to the limit you should see those dots get further and further away from the middle.

##### Solution

This one is more difficult and every instance is very different. If you want to work on your friction circle this is where personalized coaching becomes very important. This is where the Blayze data analysis service is so powerful.

Simply upload your data and video from any systems and receive back a coaching video where the coach breaks down what you send in and gives you specifics on what you can do to improve. To learn more [click here](/pricing/).
