## Charlotte Roval Race Track Notes


### 1) Start With Later Turn Ins

There are many blind corners on this track and lots of areas where you turn-in, apex, or track-out right against a wall. Be sure to start with later turn-ins until you get familiar with the layout and start carrying more speed with earlier turn-ins.



### 2) Focus On Entry To NASCAR T2

Like any track, the most important corner is the one leading onto the longest straight, but in this case the entry at NASCAR T2 is critical because of the percentage of time spent at full throttle. Racers will want to find a drafting partner if possible. Without the chicane, the entry of NASCAR T3 can be intimidating as the banking is much tighter than most Rovals. A minimum speed in the ballpark of 135 is not uncommon for fairly low-prep cars, so it is fast and unforgiving.



### 3) Eyes Up!

Keep your eyes up through the many long corners and use the banking (even on the infield) to your advantage!
