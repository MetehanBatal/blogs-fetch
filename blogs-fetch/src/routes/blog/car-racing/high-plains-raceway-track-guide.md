## High Plains Raceway Race Track Notes

### Turn 1

Turn 1 there is not a great braking marker or turn in marker. We want to trail brake all the way down to the apex and use all the road on corner exit. Apex right about mid apex curb and that is where we pick up initial throttle. Your hands at corner exit should never be straight, you want a constant arc of turning back to the left. You should be able to get back to about 3/4ths of the way back to the left before turning in for turn 2.

### Turn 2

In turn 2 we want to attack that entry and have a very smooth and slow turn in. The apex is very far around this corner and comes about mid apex curb, it is really important to not apex too early or pick up throttle too early here. Our initial throttle should only come as we get the car pointed and heading towards the apex point.

### Turn 3

There is not a great marker for the turn in here. The key is trying to get back to full throttle just passed the apex so you can gain time all the way down to turn 4. Apex right about mid apex curb and use all the road at corner exit.

### Turn 4

We want to maximize our run through turn 4 and bring in as much speed as possible and use all the road at corner exit. Our turn in comes just before the start of the safety station on the left, which is not an ideal marker. We want to apex the middle of the apex curb and pick up the throttle aggressively there. Use all the road on exit but hustly it back to the right to setup for turn 5.

### Turn 5

Turn 5 drops downhill at entry so we need to reduce our speed pretty early here and have a slightly earlier turn in. Our turn in comes just before the road really starts to drop downhill. We want to apex the middle of the apex curb and pick up our initial throttle then. Use all the road at corner exit.

### Turn 6

The braking zone is downhill here so we have a little bit less braking grip than normal here. This is similar to turn 2 with a very late apex. We want a deep trailbrake and a very slow and progressive turn in here. The important thing here is to apex the middle of the apex curb and only pick up the throttle there. Ideally we bring in a lot of entry speed and trail brake all the way down to that point. Have your eyes up to open your hands as early as possible so you can get back to full throttle as early as possible after the apex.

### Turn 7

We want to maximize our run through the uphill turn 7, use all the road at corner exit and don't sacrifice any speed to setup for turn 8. We want a little bit earlier of a turn 9, comes just before the safety station on the left and apex the start of the apex curb.

### Turn 8

We are running uphill towards the braking zone and the road flattens out right as we arrive to the braking point. We want to try and wait until the road crests before braking. We are focused on maximizing our exit here, so our apex comes about 2/3rds of the way around the apex curb. That is where we want to aggressively get back to full throttle to get a great exit and use all the road on the right.

### Turns 9a, 9b and 10

Before turning into turn 9 we want to get about a half car width or so back to the left. We are apexing the start of the apex curb and holding it along the apex curb. The exit here can be a bit blind and we need to hold it a little bit to the right to setup for turn 9b. We want to be about mid road on the exit out of turn 9a and we want to apex the start of the apex curb for 9b. We can let the car drift slightly to the right at exit of 9b, no more than a half car width or so.

We want to be back all the way to the left before turning in for turn 10. Turn 10 is a really light brake zone to help get the weight on the front nose and get it turned in. It is downhill so we want that earlier turn in point. Our apex and initial throttle spot should come right at the middle of the apex curb. Use all the road on corner exit.

### Turn 11

Turn 11 is another very late apex here, we want a smooth progressive turn in and not treat this like a double apex corner. Our turn in comes just before the start of the corner worker station on the left. We need to ensure we turn slow enough to hit a very late apex which comes 2/3rds of the way around the apex curb. As the road starts to go uphill is when we want to start turning a little more aggressively towards that apex curb and we want to pick up initial throttle as we get down to the apex. Open your hands and use all the road at corner exit to maximize your exit.

### Turns 13 - 15

The most important thing in this section is trying to get back to full throttle as early as possible onto the front straightaway. For lower horsepower cars this will come at the exit of 13, some cars may need to lift through 14 and rarely 15. So, focus on the exit out of turn 13. We have an uphill braking zone, so you can brake pretty deep and hard.

The road crests rigth at the apex for turn 13 so expect it to be hard to put power down. Occasionally waiting for the car to land after the crest and then getting aggressively back to throttle can be best.
