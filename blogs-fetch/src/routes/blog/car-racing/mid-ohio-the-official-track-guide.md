## Mid Ohio Race Track Notes

### Turn 1

Having your eyes up here is extremely important.  Trail braking and rolling entry speed will really help with finding speed in this corner.  We want a light and late brake with a turn in point just before the bridge.

Nice and slow hands after turn in so that you apex only when the apex curb starts.  That is also our initial throttle application spot.  We want to already be looking for the exit curb by the time we get here, and ask ourselves, "how early can I open my hands?"  Use all of the track on exit to maximize our run to the Key Hole.

### Key Hole

We want to treat this corner as a double apex.  I want enough speed so that I can trail brake past my first apex and have the car take me about 1 car width off the inside of the corner in the middle of the corner.  I only want the car to start carving its way back to the apex after the road starts to fall away from me.

There are no great markers here for either apex, but you can see patches in the asphalt as we are getting ready to arrive at our second apex.  Ideally, I am trail braking all the way down to that second apex and picking up my initial throttle there.  If you can't get back to full throttle before the exit curb it is likely you were too early to initial throttle and induced understeer.

### Turn 5

Entry speed is important here.  We want a decently early and slow turn in (right before that change of pavement colour) so that we can take advantage of the little bit of camber this corner has.  We want to apex about mid apex curb and bring enough speed so that when we pick up the throttle there we use all the road on exit.

### Turn 6

Use all the road out of turn 5 but don't be lazy into 6.  Try to work the car slightly back to the right before turning into turn 6 (aprox. 1 car width).  We want to apex the start of the apex curb and hold there for around 2 or 3 car lengths.  We want to start opening our hands before we can actually see the track exit so that after the crest of the hill you use all the road and still give yourself enough time to get back all the way left before turning into turn 7, but you will need to hustle there.

### Turn 7

This is a bit of a sacrifice corner to set up for madness.  We want to trail brake all the way down to the apex to help keep it right.  I don't want to end up any further left than about mid road on exit.

### Thunder Valley

I want to apex about mid curb as we start heading uphill into madness.  As we get ready for the crest of the hill I want to be mid road and then apex the curb on our right as we are dropping down the hill.

### Turn 9

Late braking is not the key here.  I actually want to focus on a slightly earlier and lighter brake zone so that I can balance the car with an early turn in point and lots of entry speed up this hill.  I want to apex just after the start of the apex curb and use ALL of this apex curb, that is where all the grip is.  That is also my initial throttle application spot.  Be careful on exit, cars will get light as you crest the hill.  Often times the car will understeer about 1 car width wider than you are initially expecting as you crest the hill, or the rear can get light and cause a little oversteer.

### Turn 11 (Fast Left Hander)

I am usually braking as the wall starts to bend to the right here and I want to steer to the right to follow the wall.  I am turning in just before the grass starts on the right.  My apex point is the start of the apex curb and that is also where I want to pick up initial throttle.  Use all the road on the exit.

### Carousel

Trail braking deep into this corner is key.  I want a hard initial brake, but start to lighten up on pressure quickly.  As I crest the small hill I want to be on very light brake pressure and have enough entry speed that the car takes me about mid road through the middle of the corner.  I want to apex the middle of the curb for my second apex and only pick up initial throttle there.  Any earlier throttle application was a lack of patience or an over slow problem through the corner.

### Turn 13

Some cars are flat through this corner and others aren't.  I want to try and sacrifice enough speed out of the carousel to keep my car right to maximize the radius of this corner and be flat.  If I can use more track and still be flat through turn 13 then I will do that.  If I am in a car that will not be flat no matter what I want to be about a half car width to one car width off the right side of the road before turn in.
