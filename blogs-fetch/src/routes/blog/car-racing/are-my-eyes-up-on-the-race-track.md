## Are My Eyes "Up" Enough On The Race Track?

Is there any term said more around a race track than, “You just have to keep your eyes up”? Definitely not, we have all said it to a friend, been told this, or said it to ourselves. We might even say it every single day at a race track. But, most of us end up thinking one thing after we have been told to keep our eyes up… What the hell does that actually mean??How do I know if they are up or too low?

At Blayze we focus on coaching with actionable information and making sure you have specific ways to measure or know where you should actually be looking in a corner. In this video, we are working with Scott.

Scott is driving at a really high level and has solid fundamentals, so over the past year we have been helping him in the areas he is losing the most amount of time. Here at Thunderhill, it happens to be at corner entries. A very important part of being able to find the limit at corner entry is having your eyes up early enough to be able to start trailing off the brakes early enough to maximize entry speed.

You can see in the video that his head is turning and focusing on finding the apex only a split second before his hands start to turn into the corner. Here we can tell he is largely focused on his turn in point all the way down until he is actually at the turn-in point, his eyes are not 1.5 - 2 steps in front of the racecar.

For Scott to correct this we want him identifying his turn-in point and focusing on it before he hits the brakes initially. Then almost directly after that point and long before he arrives at his turn-in point, he needs to shift his focus to the apex and allow his periphery vision to pick up the turn in marker.

Once he has started to turn in and is carving towards the apex he needs to get his eyes up and focus on the corner exit. We always want our drivers looking up at the corner exit as early as possible and asking themselves, “how early can I start to unwind the steering wheel?” For those drivers looking for the last little bit, the shift of the eyes to the correct spot tends to unlock a lot of speed.

[We have another great article going through exactly where you should be looking here that we highly recommend checking out!](/blog/car-racing/vision-on-the-racetrack-where-to-look-while-racing/)

It is important to note that while this is the area Scott is focusing on, that doesn’t mean it is where you should be focusing on. Your vision may be perfect and you may need to work on other areas.
