In this months call Ricky Taylor discusses how to quickly come up to speed on any race track and how to improve your race starts.

On race starts it's important to know that sometimes you're just boxed in with no where to go. Accepting that and not trying to do too much is critical. 

Important things to know with your race starts: 

1) When you are not on pole being close but with a small gap (that you are slowly closing) allows you to be more consistent. You don't want to be too close and be caught out at the pole sitter accelerates and brakes while trying to catch out the field and get a jump/

2) If there is an acceleration zone that the series tells the pole sitter you want to know about that.  It helps you time your own acceleration.

3) Know who you're racing with (when you can).  People are typically very predicatable.
