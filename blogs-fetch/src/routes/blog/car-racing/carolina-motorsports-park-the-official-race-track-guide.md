## Carolina Motorsports Park Official Race Track Notes

### Turn 1

The braking zone arrives earlier than most think. The start-finish line will be a pretty good brake zone for most cars, for those of you in higher downforce cars you may be able to get closer to the access road.

The line on the exit of turn 1 (which effects the entry speed of turn 1) very much depends on your car. In lower horsepower cars we will be able to use all the road on exit out of turn 1 and still be flat through turn 2. So, start your weekend off by using all the road on exit and see if you can be flat through turn 2 while ending up at the right side of the road for turn 3.

If you can’t little by little sacrifice more and more until you have a good balance on entry speed in 1 and speed through turn 2.

### Turn 2

The important thing in turn 2 is to get back to the right side of the road before turn in for turn 3. That does not mean that we need to be perfectly to the right at exit of turn 2. Let the car open off the inside just a little bit on exit and then hustle it back to the right side of the road.

### Turn 3

In turn 3 the most important thing is to get back to full throttle as soon as possible after the apex. We also want a somewhat early but slow turn in to maximize our entry speed.

On exit take a look at where you car is as you arrive out to the exit curb. We want to be out and parallel with the exit curb pretty early on along it.

### Turn 4

Turn 4 is all about entry speed. We want a light and long brake so that we can trail brake to the apex without over slowing the corner. We will be apexing the start of the apex curb here and use almost all the road on exit.

### Turns 5 - 7

In turn 5 we want to get back to aggressive throttle near the end of the apex curb and make sure we use all the road on exit to open up the radius for turn 6.

In turn 6 we don’t really want to apex the inside of the track. We want to turn in at the end of the curb on our left and end up about mid-road or so in the middle of the corner. The reason for this is that we want to get back to the left side of the road before turning in for turn 7.

The most important thing in turn 7 is getting back to full throttle as early as possible after the apex. We want to apex just before the middle of the apex curb and get your eyes up and use all the road at corner exit.

### Turn 8

Another corner where getting back to full throttle as early as possible after the apex is important. We want to apex just after where the curb gets wider. Use all the road on exit again!

### Turn 10

Turn 10 is the fastest corner on the race track and it will really get your attention. The most important thing for turn 10 is to be relaxed and get your eyes up as much as possible.

We want a nice smooth turn in and we want to apex the start of the apex curb. Use all the road on corner exit so that you can roll in as much entry speed as possible.

### Turn 11

This is a super long radius corner so we do want a late apex. We want to apex about 3/4ths of the way past the down the apex curb. A lot of drivers will hold it all the way left at exit here to setup for turn 12, which we don’t want to do.

Let’s use all the road on exit to maximize our entry speed into turn 12. You want to get out to the exit curb early to give you more time to hustle the car as far to the left as you can get it.

### Turn 12

We want a nice and slow turn in so that we don’t apex too early. You will there is a short apex curb, then a small bit of grass before the second apex curb starts. We want to be apexing close to the start of the apex curb.

Get your eyes up on corner exit and open your hands as early as possible to use all the road early on.

### Turn 14

Another corner where the most important thing is to get back to full throttle as early as possible after the apex point. To be able to do that we need to apex at the middle of the apex curb so that you can open your hands at corner exit and get back to full throttle.
