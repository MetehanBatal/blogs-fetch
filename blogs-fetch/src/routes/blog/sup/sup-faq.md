## Who are the coaches?

We believe the only way to learn is to ensure you are working with the very best coaches in the world. We founded Blayze with the goal of making it more affordable and accessible for anyone to learn personally from those coaches. 

So, when you come to Blayze for coaching you can be sure that you will be working with the best minds in sports coaching. Not only have they competed at the top levels of their sports, they have a unique ability to communicate complex and technical things in a way that is easy to understand for all age groups and skill levels and actually make the changes you need!



## Can I select a specific Blayze coach to work with?

Absolutely! You can select any coach you want to work with or if you need help we can select one of our world-class coaches for you.



## What video should I upload to my coach?

Blayze coaches recommend trying to upload 2 videos. One side angle of your paddle technique and if possible one angle of you paddling directly towards the camera.



## How long until I receive my coaching session?

Our coaches aim to turn around coaching sessions within 48 hours.



## How do I film myself?

Blayze coaches recommend trying to film yourself near a dock or land so you can set your camera up on land and paddle close enough for it to see you. Most customers film themselves using a Go-Pro or phone, but you can record yourself using any camera!



## What camera should I use?

Any camera! You can upload video from your phone, go-pro, or from any other video camera!



## Is my coaching session secure?

Yes! Only you will see your coaching video unless you decide you would like to share them.



## How do I know if I'm ready for a Blayze coach?

When you work with the very best coaches they will tailor their coaching to your experience level. So, it doesn't matter if it's your first day playing a new sport or you have been playing for 20 years, our coaches can help you! Perfect for players of all ages, experience levels, and interest levels. It doesnâ€™t matter if you want to play in college or the pros one day or if you just want to beat your friend and rival, our coaches are here for you.
