## **Learning The Front Side Buoy Turn** With Connor Baxter



The first thing that Connor likes to do is break our buoy turns down into smaller steps.   This helps us make fewer movements during the full maneuver - less steps back, less strokes, less movement overall.



### Step 1: Hop Back

Connor's very first movement in preparation for a Buoy turn is to hop back on the board.  He squats down just a little bit and in one motion takes a small hop towards the back of the board.  He then takes one more stroke to keep up his momentum.



### Step 2: Big Step Back

At this point, we need to take one big step back with one foot all the way to the tail of the board.  All of this allows Connor to get to the tail of the board in just 2 movements vs. the 3 or 4 movements it takes most SUP riders while also carrying speed throughout the entire movement.



### Step 3: The Rainbow Stroke

From the back of the board with a wide and balanced stance, Connor reaches as far forward on the board as he can get to start his stroke.  In one long stroke he then sweeps back all the way to the tail of the board.



#### Always Focus On Your Vision

As SUP athletes we need to be hyper focused on having our eyes focused on the right things.  We always need to be looking at where we want to go.


As Connor is in the middle of his buoy turn you will see his head is turned and his eyes are focused on where he wants to go.  We don't want to be looking down at the board, or down at the water.



### Step 4: The Hop Forward

Just like in our hop back we want to do this in one motion.  We leave and land with both of our feet



### The Takeaways 

- **Keep Your Speed Up!**  The Buoy turn is like a bicycle, when you slow down it gets more unstable.  So, keeping your speed up will make it easier to keep balanced.
- **Reduce The Movement** by making fewer moves we are not only becoming more efficient we are also reducing the chances of falling in the water.
