Have you ever wanted a handy guide to break down how to handle each turn at the Daytona International Speedway’s karting race track? Follow along here as Blayze professional karting driver, Chris Wehrheim, takes us through each of the nine turns for the karting track. He will provide tips on how to handle entry points and exits so that you can be well prepared before putting wheels down in Daytona.

## Daytona International Speedway

[The Daytona International Speedway](https://www.daytonainternationalspeedway.com/about-us/) is nearly 500 acres and has one of the most diverse schedules of racing worldwide and is often referred to as the “World Center of Racing”. The Speedway hosts daily track tours, is home to the Daytona 500, and houses the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America. Famous drivers like Richard Petty, Carl Yarborough, and Dale Earnhardt have all seen success at Daytona.

The track features multiple layouts, a high-speed tri-oval sports car course, a karting and motorcycle flat-track, and a motorcycle course. Each year the Daytona International Speedway hosts various events like the Nascar Cup Series – Daytona 500 and Coke Zero Sugar 400, the Trans-Am Series, the WeatherTech SportsCar Championship, the Monster Energy AMA Supercross, and even the [World Karting Association’s Daytona KartWeek](https://www.worldkarting.com/tag/daytona-kartweek/).

Let’s take a look at the nine turns you will encounter while racing on the karting track.

### Turn 1

In turn one, focus on pointing the kart more directly into the corner before trying to brake as late as possible. Remember to not open up too wide on the entry, especially if you have pressure from behind. As the kart begins to rotate before the apex, begin to pick up the throttle. On the exit, do not track out all of the way. Leave about 3 feet from the track out curbing to set up better for turn 2 kink.

### Turn 2

For this turn, you will want to take it flat out and minimize steering input to scrub as little amount of speed as possible. If you have a good run on the kart in-front you can dive to the inside after turn 2 and make a move into the turn 3 brake zone.

### Turn 3

With turn three, focus on roll speed/minimum speed. It is very easy to over slow the entry to this corner at Daytona International Speedway's kart track. Make sure to use all of the apex curbing and use all of the track on the exit. You can get away with a slightly earlier turn in because the track opens on the exit.

### Turn 4 and 5

Use all of the apex curbing on turn 4 to set up more to the left for turn 5. When braking for turn 5, be sure to have your hands straight and again focus on not over slowing the entry of the corner. Use the Apex curb of turn 5 and do not pick up the throttle too soon. This will force the kart wide on the exit and will cost you speed down the next straight that leads into the next passing zone.

### Turn 6

A great passing opportunity at Daytona International Speedway's kart track. Focus on late braking and holding the brake all the way to just before the apex to keep the front planted. If you pick up the throttle too soon the kart will run wide on the exit and force you to enter turn 7 with a narrow entry. On the exit of turn 6, you will want to keep a tight exit following the yellow curbing on the right.

### Turn 7

Entering the double apex turn 7, use light brake pressure to keep your roll speed up through the center of the corner. To keep the kart balanced, you may need a little throttle through the center to keep your speed up and weight on the rear of the kart. Be sure not to be too narrow through the center as this will cost you speed through the second exit or force you to enter turn 8 narrow. Be sure to use all of the apex curbing on the second apex of turn 7.

### Turn 8

Get excited because you are nearing the end of the track. In turn 8, this is a middle to late apex corner that is very easy to enter narrow and early because of trying to carry too much speed through turn 7. Be sure to use all of the apex and track out curbing.

### Turn 9

There is a theme here, do not overslow the entry! This corner is all about roll speed and picking up the throttle just before the apex to get a good run onto the front straight. Watch the exit as it is very easy to drop a wheel forcing you to defend into turn 1 during the races. Congratulations – you just made it through all nine turns…now let’s do it again!
