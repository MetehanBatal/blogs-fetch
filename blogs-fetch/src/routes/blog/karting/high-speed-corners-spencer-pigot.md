<strong>3:00 - How To Approach A Longer Race Weekend</strong>
<br />
How do you prepare for a 4-5 day race weekend versus a normal 2-3? Go in with a good plan! You do not need to rush your preparation, but don’t get too complacent either. Focus on one part of the race track at a time. The only way to find the limit of yourself and the car is to go out and test it. The more time you spend at the limit the more comfortable you are with it and the more prepared you will be.

<strong>11:00 - Should You Lift or Light Brake on a Fast Corner?</strong>
<br />
How to handle a corner that is a borderline lift or light brake? It is more beneficial to do a lift because you won’t transfer the weight as aggressively. In a fast corner, typically cars can become unstable with weight transfers. It also helps to give you more control over the speed you knock off. For example, as soon as you hit the brake, your speed drops instantly. With a lift, it allows you to have more control over the decrease in your speed.
