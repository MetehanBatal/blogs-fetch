The number one thing to know when racing in the wet is we need to experiment.   

In dry racing conditions there is usually one single consistent racing line.  In the wet where the grip is can change.  Even at the same track from one session to the next, even from one lap to the next the grippy line can change. 

In this video pro driver and Blayze coach, [Colin Mullan](https://blayze.io/coach/colin-mullan), shows an example of how he finds grip in the wet during his first laps on track. Here are some things he does from behind the wheel to learn how much grip he has: 

1) Smoothly modulates the throttle 

2) Back up brake zones to get a feel for the grip 

3) Look for where a slightly dryer line has formed 

4) If you have abs or traction control increase it (if you can) 

5) Take lots of mental notes!

   

In addition to experimenting to find the level of grip in the wet he also has some mental models that he has in the back of his mind when driving in the wet: 

1) Avoid painted line and curbs when possible 
2) Lighter and longer brake zones in the wet to keep the platform of the car 
3) Typically any sealant or the rubbered in line will be the slickest line in the wet 
4) Smoother inputs in the wet
