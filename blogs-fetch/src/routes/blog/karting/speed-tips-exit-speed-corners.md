# Getting The Most Out Of Exit Speed Corners

### Exit Speed Corners

We are often told that it is the first person back to throttle that wins an exit speed corner.  But, that often leads drivers or riders to applying the throttle before they ever get to the apex.



At Blayze we know it is far more often the first driver or rider back to full throttle after the apex point that wins the exit speed corner.  Why do we specify only after the apex point?  Well, in most cases if they can get back to full throttle before the apex that means they have way overslowed corner entry.
