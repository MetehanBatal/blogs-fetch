This track rewards hard driving. You need to be on the limit every lap around this track to be fast.<br/>2) Make sure you hit the curbs with the steering wheel straight. Any input in the wheel while hitting the curb will result in a counter-steer.<br/>3) Always focus on the next corner. This track has many corners that closely follow the other. If you do not focus on the next corner, you will not be set up correctly."}
