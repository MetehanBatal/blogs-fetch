Here are the topics Colin discussed this month:
<br />
<strong>2:50 - High-Speed Corners:</strong>
<br />
You do not want to put too much load into the car in high-speed corners. A general rule of thumb is to keep that platform stable. High-Speed braking can lead to oversteer and other issues.
<br />
<br />
<strong>11:55 - Fuel Saving</strong>
<br />
A general rule is that short shifting and trying to stay in higher gear creates more time loss. This really is not efficient at having fuel over the lap. Example lap from Virginia International Raceway.
<br />
<br />
<strong>30:00 - Turn 5 at Road Atlanta</strong>
<br />
Turn 5 at Road Atlanta is super tricky. You are trying to brake while getting the car loaded into the opposite direction. The key in this corner is to not overdo it on the brakes. Extend the braking zone. Loading the car in multiple directions, you do not want to add in too much braking or you can overload the tires or potentially lock your front tires.
<br />
<br />
<strong>47:00 - How to not crash into someone while passing</strong>
<br />
How do you pass someone while gaining speed but also ensuring you do not crash into them? Or better yet, how can you ensure that the other driver you are passing has the knowledge that you are there? It helps to identify the car you intend to pass a few corners ahead of passing them. Plan when you feel it is safest to pass the driver. Do not try any late attempts if they donâ€™t see you.
