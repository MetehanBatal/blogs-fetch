## Who are the coaches?

We believe the only way to learn is to ensure you are working with the very best coaches in the world. We founded Blayze with the goal of making it more affordable and accessible for anyone to learn personally from those coaches. 

So, when you come to Blayze for coaching you can be sure that you will be working with the best minds in sports coaching. Most of our karting coaches are the top karters in the world or have even competed in IMSA WeatherTech, IndyCar, and more. Not only have they competed at the top levels but they also have a unique ability to communicate complex and technical things in a way that is easy to understand and actually make the changes you need!



## Do I need a specific type of camera?

You can upload video from any camera system! No data overlays are needed, even video off a phone or go-pro camera will work. Of course, if you have more advanced cameras with data our coaches can work with that! 



## Where should I place my camera?

The best view for our coaches is where the camera is on the radiator of the kart looking forward. But, as long as we can see off the front of the kart and the road in front we can likely work with it!



## Can I upload my data?

Yes! When purchasing a session analysis or racing analysis session you can upload your data files from any data system. When uploading please include your video (if possible) and upload all data files from your session. It also helps to let your coach know what data system you are using.



## Can I select a specific coach?

Absolutely! You can select any coach you want to work with or if you need help we can select one of our world-class coaches for you.



## How long until I receive my coaching session?

Our coaches aim to turn around coaching sessions within 48 hours.



## Can Blayze do in-weekend coaching during my race weekends?

Yes! You can schedule same day turn around sessions while purchasing your coaching session. Just select your option and click the same day turn around option. After purchasing you can select the date you wanted to schedule it for. 



## How do I know if I'm ready for a Blayze coach?

When you work with the very best coaches they will tailor their coaching to your experience level. So, it doesn't matter if it's your first day karting or you have been competing at SuperNats for multiple years, our coaches can help you! Perfect for drivers in any type kart, any experience level, and it doesn't matter what your goals are we can help you achieve them.
