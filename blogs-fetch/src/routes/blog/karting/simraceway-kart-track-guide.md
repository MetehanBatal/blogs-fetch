Donâ€™t be deceived by the increased grip because of increased elevation on entry into the corner because almost all the corners fall away on exit<br />2) Focus on a late acceleration and make sure the kart is straight. This will reduce the amount of slide on exit of the corner<br />3) Make sure the kart is straight before jumping the curbs in the Tic-Tac-Toe section to reduce bouncing off of the curbs"}
