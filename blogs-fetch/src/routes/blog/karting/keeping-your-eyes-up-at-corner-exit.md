### Video Transcript

Hey, guys. Welcome to the new Blayze video. This week, we're going to be talking about how your eyes on the action in the corner can really affect not using all of the road. We're going here at turn 16, at a recent client of ours, Steven, on how we went from practice to qualifying.

So we're here in slo-mo, going out at 15. So we're not using all the road because it's part of how you set up. Get over. Now, we're going to use approaching, turning in. Now 16 is out of the straightaway, so getting a good exit, then using all of the road is critical.

So we're starting to apply throttle here, which is exactly what we want to do. Now your eyes need to be looking for the exit to use all the road. You can see already here we're fighting for traction. We're trying to save the car. Now that's fantastic. It's good that you're at the limit of the car, but you need to make sure you're using all of the road while you do that.

As we move forward a little bit here, look right here. We're not actually using all the road. So he's just making his life way more difficult on himself by pinching the axis. Doing that, because he's not looking as far forward as possible, so he doesn't know when he can open his hands and use the road. His eyes are looking just out in front of his car rather than far forward.

So now we're going to go later in the weekend. We're here at qualifying now. Unfortunately, the sun is not perfect. It's being a little bit difficult to see. Once again with the same apex, we're going to apply throttle. We're not going to fight the car this time. Look. His hands are still straight. He's probably at the same throttle, but he's able to keep the car straight because he's opened his hands earlier, which it means he can put more traction down, and use all the road.

The arrow's pointing to the white line there, so I'm trying to show you how much more of the road he's actually using, simply because he's looking farther forward and he can open his hands.

That was this week's video. Hope you guys enjoyed it. If you did, please give us a like or a subscribe. We really appreciate that at Blayze, and make sure to tune in next week for the new video.
